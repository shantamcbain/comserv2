# AI Behavior Enforcement Rules

## MANDATORY PROMPT TRACKING
**CURRENT PROMPT:** This is prompt #[X] of 5 maximum allowed prompts.

### Prompt Counter Protocol
- **Start Each Response:** Begin every response with current prompt count
- **Track Internally:** Keep running count throughout conversation
- **Warn at Prompt 4:** Alert user that next prompt will trigger handoff
- **Stop at Prompt 5:** Refuse to continue, provide handoff documentation

## MANDATORY APPROVAL WORKFLOW

### Before ANY Code Changes
1. **STOP:** Do not modify any files without explicit user approval
2. **PRESENT:** Show exactly what will be changed using the standard format
3. **WAIT:** Wait for explicit approval ("yes", "approved", "apply changes")
4. **CONFIRM:** Acknowledge approval before proceeding
5. **EXECUTE:** Apply changes only after confirmation

### Standard Change Presentation
```

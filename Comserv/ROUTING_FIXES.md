# Routing Fixes for MCoop Controller

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the routing issues with the MCoop controller, specifically for the Server Room Plan page.

### 1. MCoop Controller Updates

- Enhanced the namespace configuration to ensure proper routing
- Added multiple route definitions for the server room plan:
  - Standard route: `/mcoop/server-room-plan`
  - Direct access route: `/server-room-plan`
  - Chained route: `/mcoop/server-room-plan` (using the base method)
- Improved the base method to properly set up the MCoop site context
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose any future routing issues

### 2. Root Controller Updates

- Removed temporary emergency routes that were handling MCoop functionality
- Added proper forwarding methods that redirect to the MCoop controller
- Updated the default 404 handler to properly forward MCoop-related requests
- Improved error handling for MCoop paths

### 3. Template Updates

- Updated all links in the templates to use the correct paths:
  - Changed `/server-room-plan` to `/mcoop/server-room-plan` in the navigation
  - Updated the admin dropdown menu links
  - Fixed links in the main content area

## Architectural Improvements

These changes follow the proper architectural pattern where:

1. Each site's functionality is encapsulated in its own controller
2. The Root controller only forwards to the appropriate site controller
3. Routes are defined in the controller that owns the functionality
4. Multiple route definitions provide flexibility in URL structure

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Access `/mcoop` to verify the MCoop home page loads correctly
2. Click on the Server Room Plan links to verify they work
3. Try accessing `/mcoop/server-room-plan` directly
4. Try accessing `/server-room-plan` directly (should forward to the MCoop controller)

## Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing a more robust routing system that automatically maps site-specific URLs
2. Add more comprehensive logging for route resolution
3. Create a centralized route registry to avoid duplication

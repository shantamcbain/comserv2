# Template Error Fix and Documentation Organization

**File:** /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/Comserv/docs/2025-05-20-template-error-fix-and-docs-organization.md  
**Date:** May 20, 2025  
**Author:** System Administrator  
**Status:** Implemented

## Overview

This document outlines two important changes made to the Comserv system:

1. Fixed a template error in the pagetop.tt file that was causing numeric comparison errors
2. Created a script to organize documentation files by moving them from the Comserv root directory to the docs directory

## 1. Template Error Fix

### Issue Description

The system logs were showing the following error repeatedly:

```
Argument "" isn't numeric in numeric gt (>) at /home/comserv/public_html/comserv2/Comserv/root/pagetop.tt line 55.
```

This error occurred when the template tried to perform a numeric comparison on `c.session.roles.grep('admin').size` when `c.session.roles` was either undefined or not an array.

### Solution

Modified line 55 in `pagetop.tt` to include proper checks before attempting to use the `grep` method:

```tt
[% SET is_admin = c.session.roles.defined && c.session.roles.size && c.session.roles.grep('admin').size > 0 ? 1 : 0 %]
```

This change ensures that:
1. `c.session.roles` is defined
2. `c.session.roles` has a size (meaning it's an array with elements)
3. Only then tries to grep for 'admin' and check if the size is greater than 0

The ternary operator (`? 1 : 0`) ensures that `is_admin` is always set to either 1 or 0, which is what the template expects.

### Impact

This fix prevents template rendering errors when users are not properly logged in or when session data is incomplete. The error was appearing for various site names including BMaster, Forager, and CSC.

## 2. Documentation Organization

### Issue Description

The Comserv root directory contained numerous markdown documentation files that should be organized in the dedicated docs directory. These included:

- Files with "Formatting title from:" prefix
- Date-based update files (starting with years like 2024, 2025)
- Other documentation files with keywords like "fix", "documentation", "system", "guide", or "management"

### Solution

Created a bash script (`move_md_files.sh`) to systematically move documentation files from the Comserv root directory to the docs directory. The script:

1. Moves files with the "Formatting title from:" prefix to the docs directory, using the original filename
2. Moves date-based update files (starting with years like 2024, 2025)
3. Moves other documentation files with specific keywords in their names
4. Skips certain system files that should remain in the root (like THEME_SYSTEM files and ROUTING_FIXES)
5. Logs all operations to a log file for review

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to move markdown files from Comserv root to Comserv/docs
# This includes files with "Formatting title from:" prefix and date-based update files

SOURCE_DIR="/home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/Comserv"
DEST_DIR="/home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/Comserv/docs"

# Create a log file
LOG_FILE="/home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/move_md_files.log"
echo "Starting file move operation at $(date)" > "$LOG_FILE"

# Move files with "Formatting title from:" prefix
for file in "$SOURCE_DIR"/Formatting*; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    # Extract the original filename
    original_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/.*Formatting title from: //')
    
    # Check if the file already exists in the destination
    if [ -f "$DEST_DIR/$original_name" ]; then
      echo "File already exists: $original_name - skipping" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    else
      # Move the file to the docs directory with its original name
      mv "$file" "$DEST_DIR/$original_name"
      echo "Moved: $file -> $DEST_DIR/$original_name" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    fi
  fi
done

# Move date-based update files (files that start with a year like 202*)
for file in "$SOURCE_DIR"/202*.md; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    filename=$(basename "$file")
    
    # Check if the file already exists in the destination
    if [ -f "$DEST_DIR/$filename" ]; then
      echo "File already exists: $filename - skipping" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    else
      # Move the file to the docs directory
      mv "$file" "$DEST_DIR/$filename"
      echo "Moved: $file -> $DEST_DIR/$filename" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    fi
  fi
done

# Move other documentation files that have "fix" or specific documentation terms in their names
for file in "$SOURCE_DIR"/*fix*.md "$SOURCE_DIR"/*documentation*.md "$SOURCE_DIR"/*system*.md "$SOURCE_DIR"/*guide*.md "$SOURCE_DIR"/*management*.md; do
  # Skip if the pattern doesn't match any files
  [ -e "$file" ] || continue
  
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    # Skip certain system files we want to keep in the root
    if [[ "$file" == *"THEME_SYSTEM"* || "$file" == *"NEW_THEME_SYSTEM"* || "$file" == *"ROUTING_FIXES"* ]]; then
      echo "Keeping in root: $file" >> "$LOG_FILE"
      continue
    fi
    
    filename=$(basename "$file")
    
    # Check if the file already exists in the destination
    if [ -f "$DEST_DIR/$filename" ]; then
      echo "File already exists: $filename - skipping" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    else
      # Move the file to the docs directory
      mv "$file" "$DEST_DIR/$filename"
      echo "Moved: $file -> $DEST_DIR/$filename" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    fi
  fi
done

echo "File move operation completed at $(date)" >> "$LOG_FILE"
echo "See $LOG_FILE for details of the operation."
```

### Impact

This organization improves the project structure by:
- Keeping all documentation in a dedicated directory
- Making it easier to find and manage documentation files
- Reducing clutter in the root directory
- Maintaining a consistent organization pattern for documentation

## Execution Instructions

### Template Fix

The template fix has been applied directly to the file and should take effect immediately.

### Documentation Organization

To execute the documentation organization script:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/move_md_files.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/move_md_files.sh
   ```

3. Review the log file to confirm the operations:
   ```bash
   cat /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/move_md_files.log
   ```

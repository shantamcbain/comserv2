This document explains how to configure and manage NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) API keys across different Catalyst environments (production, staging, development).



## Environment-Specific Configuration



The application now uses environment-specific configuration files for NPM API keys and settings. These files are located in the `Comserv/config/` directory:



- `npm-production.conf` - Production environment configuration

- `npm-staging.conf` - Staging environment configuration

- `npm-development.conf` - Development environment configuration



### Configuration File Format



Each configuration file follows this format:



```

<NPM>

  api_key = "npm_yourgeneratedkey123_1234567890"

  endpoint = "http://npm-host:81"

  environment = "production"  # or "staging"/"development"

  access_scope = "full"       # or "read-only"/"localhost-only"

</NPM>

```



### Configuration Parameters



- `api_key`: The NPM API key for authentication

- `endpoint`: The base URL of the NPM API

- `environment`: The name of the environment (production, staging, development)

- `access_scope`: The access scope for this environment:

  - `full`: Full access to all API operations

  - `read-only`: Only read operations are allowed

  - `localhost-only`: Only accessible from localhost



## Deployment Strategies



### Docker-Based Deployments



For Docker-based deployments, you can use build arguments to specify the environment:



```dockerfile

# Dockerfile

ARG ENVIRONMENT=production

COPY configs/npm-${ENVIRONMENT}.conf /app/Comserv/config/npm-${ENVIRONMENT}.conf

```



Build with:



```bash

docker build --build-arg ENVIRONMENT=production -t catalyst-app .

```



### Traditional Server Deployments



For traditional server deployments, copy the appropriate configuration file:



```bash

# Deploy script

ENVIRONMENT=production

cp /etc/catalyst/npm-${ENVIRONMENT}.conf /opt/catalyst/Comserv/config/npm-${ENVIRONMENT}.conf

chmod 600 /opt/catalyst/Comserv/config/npm-${ENVIRONMENT}.conf

```



## Security Best Practices



### Key Rotation



Rotate your NPM API keys regularly:



```bash

# Monthly rotation script

curl -X POST $NPM_ENDPOINT/api/tokens/rotate -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLD_KEY"

```



After rotating the key, update the appropriate configuration file.



### Network Isolation



Configure your NPM server to only accept connections from authorized servers:



```nginx

# NPM server configuration

location /api {

   allow 10.0.1.0/24;  # Catalyst servers

   deny all;

}

```



### Audit Logging



The application logs all NPM API access with environment information:



```

[2023-08-15 12:34:56] [INFO] Using NPM environment: production with access scope: full

```



## Environment Matrix



| Environment | Config Path | Key Prefix | Access Scope |

|-------------|-------------|------------|--------------|

| Production | npm-production.conf | npm_prod_ | full |

| Staging | npm-staging.conf | npm_stage_ | read-only |

| Development | npm-development.conf | npm_dev_ | localhost-only |



## Validation Checklist



To verify that your NPM API configuration is working correctly:



```bash

# Set the environment

export CATALYST_ENV=production



# Start the application

cd /opt/catalyst

./script/comserv_server.pl



# Check the logs for NPM API configuration messages

tail -f logs/application.log | grep "NPM environment"

```



## Troubleshooting



### Common Issues



1. **"NPM API key not configured"**: This warning appears when the application cannot find a valid API key. Check that the configuration file exists and has the correct permissions.



2. **"Failed to load NPM config"**: This error occurs when the configuration file exists but cannot be parsed. Check the syntax of the configuration file.



3. **"This environment is read-only"**: This message appears when trying to perform write operations in a read-only environment. Check the `access_scope` setting in your configuration file.



### Debugging



To enable debug logging for NPM API calls:



```bash

export CATALYST_DEBUG=1

./script/comserv_server.pl

```



This will show detailed information about NPM API calls in the application log.

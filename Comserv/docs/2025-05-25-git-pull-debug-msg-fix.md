# Git Pull Debug Message Fix

**File:** /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/Comserv/docs/2025-05-25-git-pull-debug-msg-fix.md  
**Date:** May 25, 2025  
**Author:** System Administrator  
**Status:** Implemented

## Overview

This document outlines the fix for an issue in the Git pull functionality where the application was throwing an error when trying to use `debug_msg` as an array reference. The error occurred because in some cases, `debug_msg` was being set as a string instead of an array reference.

## Issue Description

The following error was occurring when accessing the Git pull functionality:

```
Caught exception in Comserv::Controller::Admin->git_pull "Can't use string ("Using Catalyst's built-in proxy "...) as an ARRAY ref while "strict refs" in use at /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv2/Comserv/script/../lib/Comserv/Controller/Admin.pm line 836."
```

The issue was that the code was trying to push values to `$c->stash->{debug_msg}` assuming it was always an array reference, but in some cases it was being set as a string.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Type Checking for debug_msg

Modified the code to check if `debug_msg` is an array reference before pushing to it, and to convert it to an array if it's not:

```perl
# Initialize debug messages array
# Make sure debug_msg is an array reference
if (!defined $c->stash->{debug_msg}) {
    $c->stash->{debug_msg} = [];
} elsif (!ref($c->stash->{debug_msg}) || ref($c->stash->{debug_msg}) ne 'ARRAY') {
    # If debug_msg exists but is not an array reference, convert it to an array
    my $original_msg = $c->stash->{debug_msg};
    $c->stash->{debug_msg} = [];
    push @{$c->stash->{debug_msg}}, $original_msg if $original_msg;
}
```

### 2. Added Safety Checks Throughout the Method

Added similar safety checks at all points in the method where values are pushed to `debug_msg`:

```perl
# Ensure debug_msg is an array reference before pushing
$c->stash->{debug_msg} = [] unless ref($c->stash->{debug_msg}) eq 'ARRAY';
push @{$c->stash->{debug_msg}}, "Some debug message";
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Robustness**: The code now handles cases where `debug_msg` might be a string instead of an array reference
2. **Better Error Handling**: Prevents the application from crashing when `debug_msg` is not of the expected type
3. **Preserved Debug Information**: Converts existing string messages to array elements instead of losing them

## Testing

The fix was tested to ensure:

1. The Git pull functionality works correctly when `debug_msg` is not defined
2. The Git pull functionality works correctly when `debug_msg` is a string
3. The Git pull functionality works correctly when `debug_msg` is already an array reference
4. Debug messages are properly displayed in the template

## Overview



This document outlines the standardization plan for controller routing in the Comserv application. The goal is to establish a consistent, maintainable, and scalable approach to defining routes across all controllers.



## Background



The Comserv application previously used a mix of routing approaches across different controllers:



1. **Path-based Routing**: Using `:Path` attribute with absolute or relative paths

2. **Local-based Routing**: Using `:Local` attribute for controller-relative paths

3. **Chained Routing**: Using `:Chained` attribute to create hierarchical route structures



This inconsistency made the codebase harder to maintain and understand, especially for new developers.



## Case Study: MCoop Controller



The MCoop controller was updated to use chained routing as a pilot for this standardization effort. The controller previously had issues with site name case handling and inconsistent routing definitions.



### Before Standardization



```perl

# Inconsistent routing with Path attributes

sub index :Path :Args(0) {

    # Implementation

}



sub server_room_plan :Path('server_room_plan') :Args(0) {

    # Implementation

}



# Direct path for backward compatibility

sub server_room_plan_underscore :Path('/MCoop/server_room_plan') :Args(0) {

    # Implementation

}

```



### After Standardization



```perl

# Base chain for all actions

sub base :Chained('/') :PathPart('MCoop') :CaptureArgs(0) {

    # Common setup for all actions

}



# Main index page

sub index :Chained('base') :PathPart('') :Args(0) {

    # Implementation

}



# Base for server room plan section

sub server_room_plan_base :Chained('base') :PathPart('server_room_plan') :CaptureArgs(0) {

    # Common setup for server room plan section

}



# Main server room plan page

sub server_room_plan :Chained('server_room_plan_base') :PathPart('') :Args(0) {

    # Implementation

}



# Direct path for backward compatibility

sub direct_server_room_plan :Path('/MCoop/server_room_plan') :Args(0) {

    # Forward to the chained action

}

```



## Standardization Plan



### 1. Chained Routing as the Standard



All controllers should use chained routing as the primary method for defining routes. This approach offers several advantages:



- **Hierarchical Structure**: Creates a clear hierarchy of routes

- **Code Reuse**: Common setup code can be placed in parent chains

- **Flexible URL Structure**: Allows for complex URL structures while keeping code modular

- **Consistent Parameter Handling**: Clear distinction between path segments and parameters

- **Better for RESTful APIs**: Makes implementing RESTful patterns easier

- **Improved Maintainability**: Scales better for larger applications



### 2. Controller Structure Template



Each controller should follow this structure:



```perl

package Comserv::Controller::Example;

use Moose;

use namespace::autoclean;



BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller'; }



# Set the namespace for this controller

__PACKAGE__->config(namespace => 'example');



# Auto method for controller-wide setup

sub auto :Private {

    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    # Controller-wide setup

    return 1; # Allow the request to proceed

}



# Base chain for all actions in this controller

sub base :Chained('/') :PathPart('Example') :CaptureArgs(0) {

    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    # Common setup for all actions

}



# Main index page at /Example

sub index :Chained('base') :PathPart('') :Args(0) {

    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    # Implementation

}



# Section base at /Example/section

sub section_base :Chained('base') :PathPart('section') :CaptureArgs(0) {

    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    # Setup specific to this section

}



# Section index at /Example/section

sub section_index :Chained('section_base') :PathPart('') :Args(0) {

    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    # Implementation

}



# Item page at /Example/section/item/123

sub section_item :Chained('section_base') :PathPart('item') :Args(1) {

    my ($self, $c, $item_id) = @_;

    # Implementation using $item_id

}



# Backward compatibility routes

sub direct_index :Path('/Example') :Args(0) {

    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    $c->forward('index');

}



__PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

1;

```



### 3. Naming Conventions



- **Base Methods**: Use `base` for the controller's base chain and `{section}_base` for section base chains

- **Index Methods**: Use `index` for the main controller index and `{section}_index` for section indices

- **Item Methods**: Use `{section}_{item}` for methods that handle specific items

- **Direct Methods**: Use `direct_{action}` for backward compatibility methods



### 4. Implementation Timeline



1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Update MCoop controller as a pilot

2. **Phase 2**: Update high-traffic controllers (CSC, USBM, BMaster)

3. **Phase 3**: Update remaining controllers

4. **Phase 4**: Add automated tests to verify routing functionality



### 5. Backward Compatibility



To maintain backward compatibility during the transition:



- Keep direct path methods for existing routes

- Forward direct path methods to their chained counterparts

- Document all URL changes for reference



## Benefits of Standardization



1. **Improved Code Organization**: Clear hierarchy makes code structure more intuitive

2. **Reduced Duplication**: Common setup code is centralized

3. **Better Maintainability**: Adding new sections or subsections is easier

4. **Consistent URL Structure**: URLs follow a predictable pattern

5. **Improved Performance**: Less code execution per request due to shared setup



## Example: MCoop Controller Update



The MCoop controller was updated to use chained routing, which resolved several issues:



1. **Fixed Site Name Case**: Ensured consistent use of "MCoop" instead of "MCOOP"

2. **Improved Code Organization**: Common setup code moved to base chain

3. **Reduced Duplication**: Removed redundant theme and site name setting

4. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Added direct path methods for existing URLs



### Key Changes



- Added a base chain for common setup

- Added a server_room_plan_base chain for the server room plan section

- Moved common setup code to the appropriate base methods

- Added direct path methods for backward compatibility



## Next Steps



1. **Documentation Updates**: Update controller documentation to reflect the new routing standard

2. **Developer Training**: Train developers on the new routing standard

3. **Code Reviews**: Ensure new controllers follow the standard

4. **Automated Testing**: Add tests to verify routing functionality

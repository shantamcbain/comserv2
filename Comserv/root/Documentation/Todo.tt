# Todo System Overview

The Todo system in Comserv provides comprehensive task management capabilities integrated with projects and logging functionality.

## Key Features

### Task Management
- **Create, Edit, Delete** todos with detailed information
- **Project Integration** - Associate todos with specific projects and subprojects
- **Status Tracking** - New, In Progress, Completed status management
- **Due Date Management** - Set and track due dates with overdue detection
- **Priority Levels** - Organize tasks by importance

### Calendar Integration
- **Month View** - Visual calendar display of todos and related logs
- **Week View** - Detailed weekly task planning
- **Day View** - Daily task scheduling and management
- **Date-based Filtering** - View todos by specific date ranges

### Project Integration
- **Project Association** - Link todos to specific projects
- **Hierarchical Projects** - Support for projects and subprojects
- **Project-based Filtering** - Filter todos by project selection

### Logging Integration
- **Activity Logs** - Track time and activities related to todos
- **Integrated Display** - View todos and logs together in calendar views
- **Time Tracking** - Accumulative time calculation for tasks

## Calendar Functionality

The Calendar functionality provides a visual representation of tasks with three main views:

### Day View
Shows all tasks scheduled for a specific day. Each task is represented as an event with start and end times corresponding to the calendar display.

### Week and Month Views
Provide overview of tasks for the respective time periods. Each day contains a summary of scheduled tasks including count and total time.

### Date Management Systems
- **DateTime::Format::ISO8601** - Used for day and calendar functionalities (ISO 8601 standard)
- **DateTime::Format::Strptime** - Used for flexible date/time handling in project logs

## Adding a Log: Step-by-Step Process
1. Click the log button (passes todo record ID and sitename to log_form)
2. Log form uses record ID to populate fields:
   - Todo record ID → todo_record_id
   - Sitename → sitename
   - Subject → abstract
   - Description → details
   - Start_date → start_date
   - Due_date → due_date
   - Current time → start_time field
   - User selects → end_time
   - Session role → admin field
   - Todo priority → priority field
   - Default "open" → status field

## Technical Implementation

### Controller (Comserv::Controller::Todo)
The Todo controller handles routing and logic for todo-related actions:

- **Index** - Fetches all todo records and stores them in the stash
- **Todo** - Fetches todos for the site, ordered by priority and start date, excluding completed (status 3)
- **Details** - Fetches specific todo by record ID and calculates accumulative time
- **Add Todo** - Prepares data for adding new todo, including fetching projects and sub-projects
- **Modify** - Updates todo record with new data, calculates total log time, and updates accumulative time
- **Create** - Creates new todo record with form data, handles project code, and validates user ID
- **Edit** - Provides edit interface with pre-populated form data
- **Day** - Fetches todos for specific day, excluding completed, calculates previous and next dates
- **Week** - Fetches todos for specific week, excluding completed, calculates start and end of week
- **Month** - Provides monthly calendar view with todos and logs integration

### Model (Comserv::Model::Todo)
The Todo model provides methods for interacting with todo data:

- **Get Top Todos** - Retrieves top 10 todos for site, ordered by priority and start date, excluding completed
- **Get Todos for Date** - Retrieves todos for specific date, ordered by priority and start date, excluding completed
- **Fetch Todo Record** - Retrieves specific todo record by ID
- **Project Integration** - Handles hierarchical project relationships
- **Status Management** - Manages todo status transitions

<h1>Todo System</h1>
<p>
    The Todo System uses two different date management systems:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DateTime::Format::ISO8601:</strong> This is used for handling dates in the ISO 8601 format, which is an international standard for date and time representations. We use this for the day and future calendar functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>DateTime::Format::Strptime:</strong> This provides more flexibility in terms of the date and time formats it can handle. We use this for calculating the time spent on projects in the logs.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Calendar Functionality</h2>
<p>
    The Calendar functionality provides a visual representation of the tasks in the Todo System. It includes three views: day, week, and month. Each view displays the tasks scheduled for the respective time period.
</p>
<h3>Day View</h3>
<p>
    The day view shows all tasks scheduled for a specific day. Each task is represented as an event on the calendar. The start and end times of the task correspond to the start and end times of the event on the calendar.
</p>
<h3>Week and Month Views</h3>
<p>
    The week and month views show an overview of the tasks scheduled for the respective time period. Each day in these views contains a summary of the tasks scheduled for that day.
</p>
<h3>Adapting the Day View</h3>
<p>
    The day view is adapted to work in the week and month views by summarizing the tasks for each day. Instead of showing each task as an individual event, the day view in the week and month views shows a summary of the tasks for that day. This summary includes the number of tasks and the total time scheduled for those tasks.

<h2>Issue Description</h2>



When trying to edit a project, the following error was encountered:



<code></code>`

Project with ID ARRAY(0x63cdc68e1d18) not found Please check the application.log for more Details. We are trying to modify a project

<code></code>`



This error occurred due to several issues:



<ol><li>The editproject.tt template had duplicate <code><form></code> tags, causing the form to be improperly submitted</li></ol>

<ol><li>The <code>editproject</code> method in the Project controller was not properly handling the project ID, especially when it was an array reference</li></ol>

<ol><li>The form in projectdetails.tt was using POST method to submit to the <code>editproject</code> action, but the action was only looking for the project_id in the body parameters</li></ol>



<h2>Solution</h2>



The solution involved several changes:



<ol><li>**Fixed the editproject.tt template**:</li></ol>

   - Removed the duplicate <code><form></code> tag that was pointing to the create_project action

   - Ensured the form properly submits the project_id



<ol><li>**Enhanced the <code>editproject</code> method in Project.pm**:</li></ol>

   - Added support for both GET and POST requests

   - Added handling for the case where project_id is an array reference

   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

   - Improved validation of the project_id parameter



<ol><li>**Updated the projectdetails.tt template**:</li></ol>

   - Changed the form method from POST to GET for the Edit Project button

   - This ensures the project_id is properly passed to the editproject action



<h2>Technical Details</h2>



The main issue was that the form in projectdetails.tt was using POST to submit to the editproject action, but the editproject action was only looking for the project_id in the body parameters. Additionally, the editproject.tt template had duplicate form tags, which was causing the form to be improperly submitted.



The solution was to:

<ol><li>Fix the editproject.tt template to remove the duplicate form tag</li></ol>

<ol><li>Update the editproject action to handle both GET and POST requests</li></ol>

<ol><li>Update the projectdetails.tt template to use GET instead of POST for the Edit Project button</li></ol>



<h2>Benefits</h2>



<ul><li>More robust project editing</li></ul>

<ul><li>Better error handling and logging</li></ul>

<ul><li>Improved user experience with clearer error messages</li></ul>

<ul><li>Fixed security issues with form methods</li></ul>



This fix ensures that users can edit projects without encountering errors related to the project ID.

<h1>Sites</h1>
<p>
   We will be hosting a number of sites on our server.  We will be hosting sites for our clients, and we will also be hosting sites for our own use.
    Sodo code for this might look like this:
    1. get the domain store it in the session.
    2. check the param('site') for an admin change in the SiteName.
    3. based on the SiteName set the site controller to define site specific routs. souch as the home page in the index . to return that page to the user. for example beemaster.ca/ would return the home page for beemaster.ca as defined in the BMaster controller.
</p>

In route auto we will use the acquired SiteName to search the site table for the record that matches the SiteName.
We will then use the SiteName to set the site controller.
The site controller will then be used to set the site specific routes.
The site specific routes will be used to return the site specific pages to the user.
For example beemaster.ca/ would return the home page for beemaster.ca as defined in the BMaster controller.
The site table record contains key information about the site.  The site table record will contain the following
fields:  the first two we want to put will be the css_view_name site_display_name these values need to be placed in
the session to set the DefaultVariables.tt for use by all other tt. in the application.

<h1>Sites</h1>
<p>
   We will be hosting a number of sites on our server.  We will be hosting sites for our clients, and we will also be hosting sites for our own use.
    Sodo code for this might look like this:
    1. get the domain store it in the session.
    2. check the param('site') for an admin change in the SiteName.
    3. based on the SiteName set the site controller to define site specific routs. souch as the home page in the index . to return that page to the user. for example beemaster.ca/ would return the home page for beemaster.ca as defined in the BMaster controller.

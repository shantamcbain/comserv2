<h2>Files</h2>

<h2>To handle file uploads from multiple users and ensure that each user can only access their own uploaded files, you can follow these steps:
</h2>
<ol>
<li>When a user uploads a file, save the file in a user-specific directory. The directory can be named after the user's unique ID or username to ensure it's unique for each user.</li>
<li>When serving files, check if the requested file is in the directory corresponding to the currently logged-in user. If it is, serve the file. If not, return an error or redirect the user.</li>
    <li>setfacl -m u:starman_user:rwx /path/to/user/directory/starman
        Yes, you can automate the process of creating the directory and setting its permissions when a new user is created in Virtualmin. You can do this by adding a script to the "Post-creation script" field in the Server Templates settings.

Here's a basic example of what the script could look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p /home/${USER}/public_html/starman

# Set the permissions
setfacl -m u:starman_user:rwx /home/${USER}/public_html/starman
```

This script will create a 'starman' directory in the 'public_html' directory of the new user's home directory and then set the necessary permissions for the 'starman_user'.

Please replace 'starman_user' with the actual username of the user under which the Starman server is running.

To add this script to the Server Template:

1. Go to Virtualmin > System Settings > Server Templates.
2. Select the template you want to modify.
3. In the Edit Server Template page, find the "Post-creation script" field under the "Actions upon server and user creation" section.
4. Enter the full path to your script in this field.

Now, whenever a new virtual server is created using this template, the script will be executed.

Remember to make your script executable by running `chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh`.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it according to your specific needs and environment.

Here's how you can modify the `handle_upload` method in the `Comserv::Model::File` model to implement this:
<code>
```perl5
sub handle_upload {
    my ($self, $c, $upload) = @_;

    # Extract the file's name and size
    my $filename = $upload->filename;
    my $filesize = $upload->size;

    # Define the allowed file types and maximum file size
    my @allowed_types = ('.jpg', '.png', '.pdf'); # adjust as needed
    my $max_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024; # 10 MB

    # Check the file type
    my ($file_type) = $filename =~ /(\.[^.]+)$/;
    unless (grep { $_ eq $file_type } @allowed_types) {
        return "Invalid file type. Allowed types are: " . join(", ", @allowed_types);
    }

    # Check the file size
    if ($filesize > $max_size) {
        return "File is too large. Maximum size is $max_size bytes.";
    }

    # Get the user's unique ID or username
    my $user_id = $c->user->id; # adjust this line to match your authentication system

    # Create a directory for the user if it doesn't exist
    my $directory = "uploads/$user_id";
    unless (-d $directory) {
        mkdir $directory or return "Failed to create directory: $!";
    }

    # Create the full path for the new file
    my $filepath = "$directory/$filename";

    # Save the uploaded file
    my $result = $upload->copy_to($filepath);

    return $result ? "File uploaded successfully." : "Failed to upload file.";
}
```
</code>
This code will save each user's uploaded files in a separate directory. When serving files, you would use a similar approach to check if the requested file is in the directory corresponding to the currently logged-in user.
To implement access control in a Catalyst application, you can create a method in your controller that checks if the requested file is in the directory corresponding to the currently logged-in user. If it is, serve the file. If not, return an error or redirect the user.
</li>
<li>
Here's a basic example of how you might implement this in your `Comserv::Controller::File` controller:
<code>
```perl5
sub serve_file :Local {
    my ($self, $c, $filename) = @_;

    # Get the user's unique ID or username
    my $user_id = $c->user->id; # adjust this line to match your authentication system

    # Create the full path for the requested file
    my $filepath = "uploads/$user_id/$filename";

    # Check if the file exists and is readable
    if (-f $filepath && -r _) {
        # Serve the file
        $c->res->header('Content-Type' => 'application/octet-stream');
        $c->res->body(scalar read_file($filepath, binmode => ':raw'));
    } else {
        # Return an error or redirect the user
        $c->res->status(403); # Forbidden
        $c->res->body('You do not have permission to access this file.');
    }
}
```
</code>
In this example, the `serve_file` method is a new action in your `Comserv::Controller::File` controller. It gets the requested filename from the URL, constructs the full path to the file based on the currently logged-in user's ID, and checks if the file exists and is readable. If it is, it serves the file to the user. If not, it returns a 403 Forbidden error.

This is a very basic example and doesn't include any error handling or security measures. In a real application, you would want to add checks to ensure the filename is safe to use in a file path, the user is authenticated, and the user has permission to access the file.

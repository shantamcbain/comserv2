# Fix for Project Edit Button and Parent Project Update

## Issue Description

Two issues were encountered when trying to edit a project from the project details page:

1. Error message when clicking the Edit button:
```
Project with ID ARRAY(0x63cdc68e7090) not found
```

2. Parent project changes were not being saved when updating a project.

## Solution

The solution involved several changes:

1. **Changed the Edit Project button in projectdetails.tt**:
   - Replaced the form with a direct link using an anchor tag
   - Added the project_id as a query parameter in the URL
   - Added CSS to style the button link properly

2. **Fixed the project_list.tt template**:
   - Changed the dropdown name from `project_id` to `parent_id` to avoid conflict with the project being edited
   - This ensures the parent project selection is properly submitted

3. **Enhanced the `update_project` method in Project.pm**:
   - Added handling for the case where project_id is an array reference
   - Added parent_id to the list of fields to update
   - Added proper handling for empty parent_id values
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Improved success message and redirect

4. **Added success and error message display**:
   - Added message containers to projectdetails.tt
   - Added CSS styling for success and error messages

## Technical Details

There were two main issues:

1. When using a form with method="GET" and a hidden input field, the project_id was being sent as an array reference instead of a scalar value. This was causing the error when trying to find the project in the database.

2. The parent_id was not being included in the update operation, and there was a naming conflict between the project being edited and the parent project selection.

The solution was to:
1. Replace the form with a direct link using an anchor tag
2. Change the parent project dropdown name to avoid conflicts
3. Add parent_id handling in the update_project method
4. Add proper success and error message display

## Benefits

- More robust project editing
- Parent project changes are now properly saved
- Better error handling and logging
- Improved user experience with success and error messages
- Fixed security issues with form methods

This fix ensures that users can edit projects and change parent projects without encountering errors.

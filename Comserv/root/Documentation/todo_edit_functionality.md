# Todo Edit Functionality

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Todo Edit functionality in the Comserv application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Edit Action to Todo Controller

Added a new `edit` action to the Todo controller that:

- Takes a record_id as a parameter
- Fetches the todo item with the given record_id
- Fetches project data and user data for dropdowns
- Calculates the accumulative time for the todo item
- Renders the edit.tt template with the todo data

### 2. Created Edit Template

Created a new `edit.tt` template that:

- Displays a form for editing todo items
- Pre-fills the form with the current todo data
- Includes dropdowns for projects and users
- Provides buttons for returning to the todo list
- Includes a button for adding log entries

## Impact

These changes ensure that:

1. The "Edit" button in the todo list now works correctly
2. Users can edit todo items with a user-friendly interface
3. The edit form includes all necessary fields and dropdowns

## Technical Details

The key issue was that the todo.tt template included a form that submitted to `/todo/edit/[record_id]`, but there was no corresponding action in the Todo controller to handle this URL. By adding the edit action and creating the edit.tt template, we've fixed this issue and improved the overall functionality of the Todo system.

The edit form submits to the existing `modify` action, which updates the todo item in the database. This ensures that the edit functionality integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.

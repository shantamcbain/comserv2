<h1>DBI Setup</h1>
<p>DBI (Database Independent Interface) is a database access module for the Perl programming language. It defines a set of methods, variables, and conventions that provide a consistent database interface, independent of the actual database being used.</p>
<p>In the `Comserv::Model::DBEncy` and `Comserv::Model::DBForager` modules, DBI is used to establish connections to the respective MySQL databases ('Ency' and 'Forager').</p>
<p>The database connection information for each module is retrieved from a JSON file named 'db_config.json', which contains details such as the database name, host, port, username, and password.</p>
<p>The `_build_dbh` method in each module is responsible for establishing the database connection using the DBI->connect method.</p>

<h2>Database Operations</h2>
<p>The `DBEncy` and `DBForager` modules provide methods for performing various database operations specific to their respective MySQL databases.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>The code includes extensive debugging output, with print statements showing the progress of execution and the values of important variables. This can be very helpful for troubleshooting problems with database operations.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The code employs security measures such as hashing passwords using the Digest::SHA module to ensure secure password storage.</p>

<h2>Catalyst Integration</h2>
<p>The `DBEncy` and `DBForager` modules are designed to be used as models in a Catalyst application. They utilize the Catalyst context object ($c) to access session data and other Catalyst features.</p>

# Fix for Project Edit Form

## Issue Description

When trying to edit a project, the following error was encountered:

```
Project with ID ARRAY(0x63cdc68e1d18) not found Please check the application.log for more Details. We are trying to modify a project
```

This error occurred due to several issues:

1. The editproject.tt template had duplicate `<form>` tags, causing the form to be improperly submitted
2. The `editproject` method in the Project controller was not properly handling the project ID, especially when it was an array reference
3. The form in projectdetails.tt was using POST method to submit to the `editproject` action, but the action was only looking for the project_id in the body parameters

## Solution

The solution involved several changes:

1. **Fixed the editproject.tt template**:
   - Removed the duplicate `<form>` tag that was pointing to the create_project action
   - Ensured the form properly submits the project_id

2. **Enhanced the `editproject` method in Project.pm**:
   - Added support for both GET and POST requests
   - Added handling for the case where project_id is an array reference
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Improved validation of the project_id parameter

3. **Updated the projectdetails.tt template**:
   - Changed the form method from POST to GET for the Edit Project button
   - This ensures the project_id is properly passed to the editproject action

## Technical Details

The main issue was that the form in projectdetails.tt was using POST to submit to the editproject action, but the editproject action was only looking for the project_id in the body parameters. Additionally, the editproject.tt template had duplicate form tags, which was causing the form to be improperly submitted.

The solution was to:
1. Fix the editproject.tt template to remove the duplicate form tag
2. Update the editproject action to handle both GET and POST requests
3. Update the projectdetails.tt template to use GET instead of POST for the Edit Project button

## Benefits

- More robust project editing
- Better error handling and logging
- Improved user experience with clearer error messages
- Fixed security issues with form methods

This fix ensures that users can edit projects without encountering errors related to the project ID.

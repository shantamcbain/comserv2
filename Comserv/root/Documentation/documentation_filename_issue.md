# Documentation Controller Filename Issue

## Issue Description

There was a critical issue with the Documentation controller in the Comserv system where the filename and package name did not match:

- The controller file was named `Documantation.pm` (with an 'a')
- But the package inside was declared as `Comserv::Controller::Documentation` (with an 'o')

This mismatch caused both the `/documentation` and `/Documentation` routes to fail, as shown in the application logs:

```
warn: [2025-04-24 09:19:25] Page not found: /documentation
warn: [2025-04-24 09:19:34] Page not found: /Documentation
```

## Resolution

The issue was resolved by ensuring the filename matches the package name:

1. The file `/home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv2/Comserv/lib/Comserv/Controller/Documantation.pm` was renamed to `/home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv2/Comserv/lib/Comserv/Controller/Documentation.pm`

2. No code changes were needed since the package was already correctly declared as `Comserv::Controller::Documentation`

## Importance of Filename/Package Consistency

In Perl, especially with frameworks like Catalyst, it's crucial that filenames match their package declarations:

- Catalyst uses the package name to determine the controller's namespace
- The filesystem path is used to locate the controller file
- When these don't match, the framework can't properly load the controller

## Logging Best Practices

When troubleshooting routing issues, always check:

1. Application logs for "Page not found" errors
2. Controller filenames and package declarations
3. Route definitions in the controller

Always use the `log_with_details` method for comprehensive logging:

```perl
$self->logging->log_with_details($c, 'info', __FILE__, __LINE__, 'method_name',
    "Detailed message with relevant information");
```

## Warning for AI Assistants

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never replace or modify existing files without explicit permission from the user. Always ask for confirmation before making changes to the codebase.**

When suggesting fixes for similar issues:

1. Identify the mismatch between filename and package
2. Recommend renaming the file to match the package (not vice versa)
3. Explain the impact of the change
4. Ask for permission before implementing the change

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    This Catalyst application is replacing our old eXtropia site which was written in Perl 4. The old site was a collection of CGI scripts and HTML pages.  The new site is written in Perl 5 using the Catalyst framework.  The new site is designed to be more modular and easier to maintain.  The new site is also designed to be more user-friendly and to provide more information to the user.</p>

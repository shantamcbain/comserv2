# Fix for Project Selection in Todo Filtering

## Issue Description

When using the Todo filtering system, the following error was encountered:

```
DBIx::Class::ResultSource::_minimal_valueset_satisfying_constraint(): Unable to satisfy requested constraint 'primary', missing values for column(s): 'id' at /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv2/Comserv/script/../lib/Comserv/Controller/Project.pm line 415
```

This error occurred because the `fetch_projects_with_subprojects` method in the Project controller was using a complex nested data structure with prefetch that was causing issues with the primary key constraints.

## Solution

The solution involved several changes:

1. **Refactored the `fetch_projects_with_subprojects` method in Project.pm**:
   - Replaced the complex prefetch approach with a more explicit and controlled method
   - Added proper error handling for each level of project fetching
   - Ensured all project objects have their ID properly set
   - Added defensive checks for SiteName

2. **Updated the Todo controller**:
   - Added error handling around the project fetching
   - Ensured the projects variable is always an array, even if empty
   - Added logging for any errors that occur

3. **Updated the todo.tt template**:
   - Added checks to ensure projects and sub_projects exist before iterating
   - Made the template more robust against undefined or empty values

## Technical Details

The main issue was in the way the project hierarchy was being built. The previous implementation used DBIx::Class's prefetch capability, which was causing issues with the primary key constraints. The new implementation fetches each level of projects separately and builds the hierarchy manually, ensuring that all objects have their primary keys properly set.

## Benefits

- More robust project selection in the Todo filtering system
- Better error handling and logging
- More defensive coding against undefined or empty values
- Improved performance by avoiding deep prefetches

This fix ensures that users can filter todos by project without encountering database errors.

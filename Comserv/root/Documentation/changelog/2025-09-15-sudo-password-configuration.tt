**Date:** 2025-09-15  

**Author:** System Administrator  

**Status:** Implemented



<h2>Overview</h2>



This update addresses an issue with the Starman server restart functionality in the Admin dashboard. Previously, when attempting to restart the Starman server, the system would encounter an error because the sudo command required a terminal to read the password.



<h2>Changes Made</h2>



<ol><li>Modified the restart_starman functionality in the Admin controller to use the <code>-S</code> option with sudo, which allows it to read the password from standard input.</li></ol>

<ol><li>Added an interactive password form that allows administrators to enter their sudo password directly in the web interface.</li></ol>

<ol><li>Maintained support for the SUDO_PASSWORD environment variable as an alternative method.</li></ol>

<ol><li>Enhanced error handling to provide clear feedback and guidance.</li></ol>

<ol><li>Updated logging to include detailed error messages for troubleshooting.</li></ol>



<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>



The Starman server restart functionality now supports two methods for providing the sudo password:



<h3>Method 1: Interactive Password Form (Recommended for Development)</h3>



When restarting the Starman server, you will now be prompted to enter your sudo password directly in the web interface:



<ol><li>Navigate to the Admin dashboard</li></ol>

<ol><li>Click on "Restart Starman Server"</li></ol>

<ol><li>Confirm that you want to restart the server</li></ol>

<ol><li>Enter your sudo password in the form that appears</li></ol>

<ol><li>Click "Restart Starman Server" to proceed</li></ol>



This method is convenient for development environments and occasional restarts.



<h3>Method 2: Environment Variable (Recommended for Production)</h3>



For automated or frequent restarts, you can still set up the SUDO_PASSWORD environment variable for the application user:



<h3>Method 1: Environment Variable in Systemd Service File</h3>



If you're running the application as a systemd service, add the SUDO_PASSWORD environment variable to your service file:



<ol><li>Edit the Starman service file:</li></ol>

   <code></code>`

   sudo systemctl edit starman

   <code></code>`



<ol><li>Add the following lines:</li></ol>

   <code></code>`

   [Service]

   Environment="SUDO_PASSWORD=your_sudo_password"

   <code></code>`



<ol><li>Restart the service:</li></ol>

   <code></code>`

   sudo systemctl daemon-reload

   sudo systemctl restart starman

   <code></code>`



<h3>Method 2: Environment Variable in Application Startup Script</h3>



If you're starting the application with a script, add the environment variable to your startup script:



<code></code>`bash

#!/bin/bash

export SUDO_PASSWORD="your_sudo_password"

<h1>Start your application</h1>

<code></code>`



<h3>Method 3: Using .env File (Development Environment)</h3>



For development environments, you can use a .env file:



<ol><li>Create a .env file in the application root directory:</li></ol>

   <code></code>`

   SUDO_PASSWORD=your_sudo_password

   <code></code>`



<ol><li>Make sure your application loads this file at startup.</li></ol>



<h2>Security Considerations</h2>



<h3>Interactive Password Form</h3>



When using the interactive password form:



<ol><li>The password is transmitted over HTTPS (if configured) to protect it in transit.</li></ol>

<ol><li>The password is not stored in the application's database or logs.</li></ol>

<ol><li>The password is only used for the current restart operation and is not persisted.</li></ol>

<ol><li>The form is only accessible to users with admin privileges.</li></ol>



<h3>Environment Variable Method</h3>



Storing the sudo password as an environment variable has security implications:



<ol><li>Ensure the environment variable or .env file is only readable by the application user.</li></ol>

<ol><li>Consider creating a dedicated sudo rule that allows the application user to restart only the Starman service without a password.</li></ol>

<ol><li>For production environments, it's recommended to configure sudo to allow the specific command without a password rather than storing the password.</li></ol>



<h2>Sudo Configuration Alternative (Recommended for Production)</h2>



A more secure approach is to configure sudo to allow the application user to restart the Starman service without a password:



<ol><li>Run <code>sudo visudo</code> to edit the sudoers file.</li></ol>

<ol><li>Add the following line (replace <code>app_user</code> with your application user):</li></ol>

   <code></code>`

   app_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart starman, /bin/systemctl status starman

   <code></code>`

<ol><li>Save and exit.</li></ol>



With this configuration, you won't need to set the SUDO_PASSWORD environment variable.



<h2>Testing</h2>



After implementing these changes, test the functionality by:



<ol><li>Logging in as an admin user</li></ol>

<ol><li>Navigating to the Admin dashboard</li></ol>

<ol><li>Using the "Restart Starman Server" functionality</li></ol>

<ol><li>Verifying that the server restarts successfully without password errors</li></ol>

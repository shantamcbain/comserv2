# HelpDesk Controller Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-18
**Type:** [FEATURE]
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes

- Created new HelpDesk controller using the chained dispatch system
- Implemented main HelpDesk landing page with support options
- Added ticket submission and status checking functionality
- Created knowledge base section for self-service support
- Added contact support page with multiple contact methods
- Updated existing HelpDesk.tt template with modern design
- Created supporting template files for all HelpDesk sections

## Motivation

The HelpDesk functionality was previously implemented as static templates without proper controller support, resulting in "Page not found" errors when accessing the /HelpDesk URL. This implementation provides a proper controller with chained actions to handle all HelpDesk-related functionality.

## Implementation Details

- Used Catalyst's chained dispatch system for consistent URL structure
- Explicitly forwarded to the TT view to ensure template rendering
- Maintained debug messages in an array for troubleshooting
- Designed to work without explicit loading in Comserv.pm
- Preserved and enhanced existing HelpDesk content

## Impact

- Fixed "Page not found" error when accessing /HelpDesk
- Improved user experience with modern, responsive design
- Enhanced support workflow with dedicated pages for different support functions
- Provided self-service options through knowledge base
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing HelpDesk content

# Database Configuration Loading Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing inconsistent behavior when accessing the `db_config.json` file from different execution environments. Specifically, when running the application using Starman versus comserv_server.pl, the file path resolution would sometimes fail because the application was being started from different directories.

## Solution
We've implemented a more robust configuration file loading mechanism that uses a two-step approach:

1. First, it attempts to load the configuration file using `Catalyst::Utils::path_to`, which resolves paths relative to the application root directory regardless of the current working directory.
2. If that fails (which can happen during application initialization), it falls back to using `FindBin` to locate the file.

This approach ensures that the configuration file can be found regardless of which directory the application is started from.

## Implementation Details

The following files were updated:

1. `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Model/DBEncy.pm`
2. `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Model/DBForager.pm`
3. `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Model/DBSchemaManager.pm`
4. `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Model/RemoteDB.pm`
5. `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Controller/RemoteDB.pm`

The core of the change involves replacing the direct use of `FindBin` with a more robust approach:

```perl
# Try to load the config file using Catalyst::Utils if the application is initialized
eval {
    $config_file = Catalyst::Utils::path_to('db_config.json');
};

# Fallback to FindBin if Catalyst::Utils fails (during application initialization)
if ($@ || !defined $config_file) {
    use FindBin;
    use File::Spec;
    $config_file = File::Spec->catfile($FindBin::Bin, '..', 'db_config.json');
    warn "Using FindBin fallback for config file: $config_file";
}

# Load the configuration file
eval {
    local $/; # Enable 'slurp' mode
    open my $fh, "<", $config_file or die "Could not open $config_file: $!";
    $json_text = <$fh>;
    close $fh;
};

if ($@) {
    die "Error loading config file $config_file: $@";
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: The application now behaves consistently regardless of how it's started.
2. **Robustness**: The fallback mechanism ensures that the configuration file can always be found.
3. **Better Error Reporting**: Enhanced error handling provides more detailed information when issues occur.

## Documentation

The `DBIDocument.tt` documentation file has been updated to reflect these changes, providing guidance for developers on how the configuration file loading mechanism works.

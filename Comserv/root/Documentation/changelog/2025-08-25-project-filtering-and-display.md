# Project Filtering and Display Enhancement

## Overview

This update enhances the project management interface by implementing a vertical card-based display with filtering capabilities. The new interface allows users to filter projects by project/sub-project and priority, making it easier to manage and navigate large project hierarchies.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Vertical Card Layout

- Changed the project display from a grid layout to a vertical card layout
- Each project is now displayed as a collapsible card that is closed by default
- Projects can be expanded/collapsed by clicking on the card header
- Sub-projects are nested within their parent project cards with proper visual hierarchy

### 2. Filtering Capabilities

- Added a filter panel at the top of the project list page with:
  - Project/sub-project dropdown (showing the full hierarchy)
  - Priority filter (High, Medium, Low)
  - Apply Filters and Clear Filters buttons
- Implemented filtering logic to show only projects that match the selected criteria
- When filtering by a specific project or sub-project, the relevant parent project card is automatically expanded

### 3. Improved Visual Hierarchy

- Sub-projects are now displayed within their parent project cards
- Added visual indicators (indentation and left border) to clearly show the project hierarchy
- Maintained consistent styling for priority badges and status indicators
- Improved spacing and alignment for better readability

### 4. Technical Improvements

- Added JavaScript functionality for collapsible cards
- Implemented helper functions to determine parent-child relationships for filtering
- Added CSS classes for filter panel, collapsible cards, and sub-project containers
- Updated the template version to reflect the changes

## Benefits

- **Improved Organization**: The vertical card layout provides a clearer view of the project hierarchy
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Users can quickly find specific projects or groups of projects
- **Better Space Utilization**: The collapsible design allows users to focus on relevant projects
- **Consistent Experience**: Maintained the same styling and functionality for project cards
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear visual cues for project relationships and hierarchy

## Implementation Details

The implementation involved updating the `project.tt` template file to:

1. Add the filter panel with dropdowns for project and priority filtering
2. Create new template macros for displaying the project hierarchy
3. Implement collapsible card functionality with JavaScript
4. Add helper functions for filtering logic
5. Update CSS styles for the new layout

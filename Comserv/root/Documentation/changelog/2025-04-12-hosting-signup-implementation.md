The hosting signup system uses the following components:

   - Handles form display and processing
   - Validates user input
   - Creates user and site records
   - Manages the signup workflow

2. **Templates**:
   - `hosting/signup_form.tt`: Displays the signup form
   - `hosting/signup_success.tt`: Displays the success page

3. **Models**:
   - `Comserv::Model::User`: Creates user accounts
   - `Comserv::Model::Site`: Creates site records
   - `Comserv::Model::DBEncy::SiteDomain`: Associates domains with sites

# Proxmox Controller Debug Message Fix - August 2024

**Date:** August 9, 2024  
**Author:** Shanta  
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

Fixed an issue in the Proxmox controller where the `debug_msg` stash variable was being used inconsistently, causing errors when it was set as a string in one controller but accessed as an array in another.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Type Checking for debug_msg

Added robust type checking for the `debug_msg` stash variable in multiple locations within the Proxmox controller:

- Added checks to ensure `debug_msg` exists in the stash
- Added checks to verify if `debug_msg` is an array reference
- Added conversion logic to transform string values into array references when needed
- Implemented consistent handling of `debug_msg` throughout the controller

### 2. Specific Locations Fixed

1. **API Endpoint Tests Section (lines 175-195)**:
   - Added type checking before pushing to `debug_msg`
   - Converted string values to arrays when necessary

2. **Authentication Failure Handling (lines 129-142)**:
   - Added type checking before pushing error messages to `debug_msg`
   - Ensured consistent array structure

3. **Debug Information Section (lines 257-267)**:
   - Added type checking before adding debug information
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Files Modified

- `/Comserv/lib/Comserv/Controller/Proxmox.pm`

## Benefits

- Fixed errors that occurred when `debug_msg` was set as a string in one controller but accessed as an array in another
- Improved robustness of the debug message system
- Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Prevented application crashes due to type mismatches

## Testing

The fixes have been tested by:
1. Verifying that the Proxmox controller loads without errors
2. Confirming that debug messages display correctly in the UI
3. Testing the interaction between different controllers that use `debug_msg`
4. Verifying that both string and array values for `debug_msg` are handled correctly

## Technical Details

### Original Issue

The controller was inconsistently handling the `debug_msg` stash variable:

```perl
# In some controllers, debug_msg was set as a string
$c->stash->{debug_msg} = "Apiary Management System - Main Dashboard";

# But in the Proxmox controller, it was used as an array
push @{$c->stash->{debug_msg}}, "API Endpoint Tests";
```

This inconsistency caused errors when a string value was accessed as an array.

### Fixed Code

Added type checking and conversion logic:

```perl
# Make sure debug_msg exists in the stash and is an array reference
if (!defined $c->stash->{debug_msg}) {
    $c->stash->{debug_msg} = [];
} elsif (ref($c->stash->{debug_msg}) ne 'ARRAY') {
    # If debug_msg is a string, convert it to an array with the string as the first element
    my $original_msg = $c->stash->{debug_msg};
    $c->stash->{debug_msg} = [$original_msg];
}

# Now it's safe to push to the array
push @{$c->stash->{debug_msg}}, "New debug message";
```

# Login Redirect Fix

**Date:** June 15, 2024  
**Type:** [FIX]  
**Author:** Development Team

## Overview

This update fixes issues with the login system's redirect functionality and improves the overall authentication process.

## Changes

1. Fixed template rendering issues in the login process
   - Replaced direct template rendering with proper redirects
   - Used flash messages instead of stash for error messages

2. Enhanced return-to-origin functionality
   - Improved handling of the referring page URL
   - Added support for explicit `return_to` parameter
   - Prevented redirects back to login-related pages

3. Updated documentation
   - Updated User controller documentation
   - Enhanced login authentication tutorial
   - Updated developer authentication system documentation

## Technical Details

The main issue was in the error handling of the login process, where the system was trying to render a non-existent template (`user/do_login.tt`) when authentication failed. This has been fixed by using redirects with flash messages instead.

Additionally, the login system now better preserves the original referring page and supports explicit redirection through the `return_to` parameter, making it more flexible for different use cases.

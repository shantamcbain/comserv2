# Ve7tit Controller Fixes - August 2024

## Issue
The Ve7tit controller was experiencing two main issues:
1. Mixed case URLs (`/Ve7tit`) were resulting in 404 errors
2. Equipment pages (`/ve7tit/equipment/FT-897`) were not being found properly

## Solution
The controller has been updated to:

1. Handle mixed case URLs properly
2. Improve equipment page routing and error handling
3. Create missing equipment templates
4. Add comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Details

### Controller Changes
- Added `direct_index` method with `:Path('/Ve7tit')` to handle mixed case URLs
- Added `mixed_case_direct_equipment` method for equipment pages with mixed case URLs
- Added helper method `_get_available_equipment` to list available equipment templates
- Improved error messages to be more user-friendly
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

### Template Changes
- Created detailed equipment templates for FT-897 and FT-891
- Updated the error template to display available equipment when a page is not found
- Added proper styling for equipment pages

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation in the standard location
- Documented controller methods, templates, and URL structure
- Added instructions for creating new equipment pages

## Testing
The following URLs now work correctly:
- `/ve7tit` - Main landing page
- `/Ve7tit` - Mixed case URL for landing page
- `/ve7tit/equipment/FT-897` - Equipment page
- `/Ve7tit/FT-897` - Mixed case URL for equipment page

Non-existent equipment pages now show a helpful error with available options.

# MCoop URL Case Sensitivity Fix

**File:** /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv2/Comserv/root/Documentation/changelog/2025-04-13-mcoop-url-case-fix-details.md  
**Date:** April 13, 2025  
**Author:** System Administrator  
**Status:** Implemented

## Overview

This document details the fix for the MCoop URL case sensitivity issue that was causing "page not found" errors when accessing `/mcoop/server-room-plan` and other MCoop URLs with lowercase paths.

## Issue Description

The MCoop controller was only handling URLs with the exact case `/MCoop/...` but not the lowercase variant `/mcoop/...`. This was causing confusion for users who were typing the URL manually or following links that used the lowercase version.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Route Handlers for Lowercase URLs

Added new route handlers in the MCoop controller to capture and process lowercase URL variants:

```perl
# Add a chained action to handle the lowercase route
sub mcoop_base :Chained('/') :PathPart('mcoop') :CaptureArgs(0) {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;
    $c->log->debug("Captured lowercase mcoop route");
}

# Handle the lowercase index route
sub mcoop_index :Chained('mcoop_base') :PathPart('') :Args(0) {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;
    $c->log->debug("Handling lowercase mcoop index route");
    $c->forward('index');
}

# Handle the lowercase server-room-plan route
sub mcoop_server_room_plan :Chained('mcoop_base') :PathPart('server-room-plan') :Args(0) {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;
    $c->log->debug("Handling lowercase mcoop server-room-plan route");
    $c->forward('server_room_plan');
}
```

### 2. Updated Links in Admin Home Page

Modified links in the admin home page to use the correct case:

```html
<a href="[% c.uri_for('/MCoop/server-room-plan') %]">Server Room Plan</a>
```

### 3. Added Documentation

Updated documentation to reflect URL case sensitivity requirements:

- Added a note in the MCoop controller documentation
- Created this changelog entry to document the fix
- Updated the user guide to mention case sensitivity in URLs

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can now access MCoop pages regardless of URL case
2. **Reduced Errors**: "Page not found" errors are eliminated for lowercase URL variants
3. **Consistent Navigation**: All links now use the correct case, ensuring consistent navigation
4. **Better Documentation**: URL case sensitivity requirements are now clearly documented

## Testing

The fix was tested to ensure:

1. Both `/MCoop/server-room-plan` and `/mcoop/server-room-plan` URLs work correctly
2. All functionality works the same regardless of URL case
3. Links in the admin home page correctly point to the proper case URLs
4. Other MCoop routes also handle case-insensitive access

# Documentation Display Fix

**Date:** 2025-04-08
**Type:** [FIX]
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes

- Fixed markdown rendering in the documentation viewer
- Added dedicated CSS for the markdown viewer
- Improved section display and collapsible content
- Fixed CSS path references in the markdown viewer template

## Motivation

The documentation system was not correctly displaying markdown content, particularly for the Documentation_Workflow.md file. The content was visible but sections were not properly formatted and details were not accessible through button clicks.

## Impact

- Improved readability of documentation pages
- Fixed section collapsing/expanding functionality
- Enhanced overall user experience when viewing documentation
- Ensured all documentation content is properly displayed and accessible

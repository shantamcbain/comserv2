# Project Edit Functionality Fix - June 2024

## Issue Description

Two issues were identified in the project editing functionality:

1. Error message when clicking the Edit button on the project details page:
   ```
   Project with ID ARRAY(0x63cdc68e7090) not found
   ```

2. Parent project changes were not being saved when updating a project.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Edit Project button in projectdetails.tt**:
   - Replaced the form with a direct link using an anchor tag
   - Added the project_id as a query parameter in the URL
   - Added CSS to style the button link properly

2. **Fixed the project_list.tt template**:
   - Changed the dropdown name from `project_id` to `parent_id` to avoid conflict with the project being edited
   - This ensures the parent project selection is properly submitted

3. **Enhanced the `update_project` method in Project.pm**:
   - Added handling for the case where project_id is an array reference
   - Added parent_id to the list of fields to update
   - Added proper handling for empty parent_id values
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Improved success message and redirect to project details page

4. **Added success and error message display**:
   - Added message containers to projectdetails.tt
   - Added CSS styling for success and error messages

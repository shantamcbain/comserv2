**Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Author:** Shanta  
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This update enhances the Comserv hosting signup system with two critical improvements: duplicate site prevention and a complete site deletion feature.

## Changes

### Duplicate Site Prevention

1. **Implementation Details**:
   - Modified the `add_site` method in Site.pm to check for existing sites with the same name
   - Added both proactive checking and error handling for duplicates
   - Implemented detailed logging for duplicate detection events
   - Added user feedback mechanisms for duplicate site attempts

2. **Benefits**:
   - Prevents database integrity issues from duplicate site names
   - Provides clear feedback to users when a site name is already taken
   - Preserves form data when a duplicate is detected, allowing easy correction
   - Improves system reliability and user experience

### Site Deletion Feature

1. **Implementation Details**:
   - Created a complete site deletion system accessible via `/site/delete`
   - Added support for deletion by either site ID or site name
   - Implemented a confirmation page to prevent accidental deletions
   - Developed thorough cleanup processes for all site components:
     - Database records
     - Associated domains
     - Controller files
     - Template directories
   - Added detailed error handling and user feedback

2. **Access Methods**:
   - By ID: `/site/delete?id=X` (where X is the site ID)
   - By name: `/site/delete?name=sitename` (where sitename is the site name)

3. **User Experience**:
   - Shows a confirmation page with site details
   - Requires explicit confirmation via checkbox
   - Performs complete cleanup of all site components
   - Redirects to the site list with a success message

## Documentation Updates

1. Updated the HostingSignup controller documentation
2. Updated the hosting signup templates documentation
3. Added detailed information about the site deletion process
4. Added information about duplicate site prevention

## Technical Notes

- Templates are correctly placed in the `/home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv/Comserv/root/site/` directory
- All changes maintain the existing logging and debug message system
- No new files were added except where absolutely necessary

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding batch site management operations
- Explore site cloning functionality
- Implement site backup and restore options
- Add site suspension/reactivation features

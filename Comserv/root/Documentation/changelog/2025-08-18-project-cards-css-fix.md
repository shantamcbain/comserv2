# Project Cards CSS Fix

**Last Updated:** August 18, 2025  
**Author:** Shanta  
**Status:** Active

## Overview

This update addresses issues with the project cards display in the Projects module. The cards were previously displaying as a list rather than in the intended card-based grid layout due to CSS loading and styling issues.

## Changes Made

### CSS Implementation

1. **Inline Critical CSS**
   - Added inline critical CSS directly in the project.tt template
   - Ensures core styles are applied even if external CSS files fail to load
   - Includes styles for cards, badges, buttons, and utility classes

2. **External CSS Improvements**
   - Enhanced the project-cards.css file with missing classes
   - Added responsive design improvements
   - Ensured compatibility with Bootstrap class naming conventions

3. **Controller Updates**
   - Added cache-busting timestamp to CSS URL to force browser cache refresh
   - Set use_fluid_container flag for better card layout
   - Added debug mode to help with troubleshooting

### Documentation Updates

1. **Updated Projects Documentation**
   - Added detailed information about the card-based UI
   - Included troubleshooting section for CSS display issues
   - Added code examples for controller configuration

2. **Added to Documentation System**
   - Registered Projects documentation in the documentation_config.json
   - Added to the Module Documentation category

## Technical Details

The fix uses a combination of:
- Inline CSS for critical rendering path
- External CSS for complete styling
- Cache-busting techniques to ensure fresh CSS is loaded
- Debug mode for easier troubleshooting

## Testing

The fix has been tested in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Mobile view (responsive design)

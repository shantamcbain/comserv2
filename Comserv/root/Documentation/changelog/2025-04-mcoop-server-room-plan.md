# MCoop Server Room Plan Implementation

**Date:** April 1, 2025  
**Author:** Shanta  
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Monashee Coop Server Room Plan feature and the subsequent menu restructuring to improve security and organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server Room Plan Implementation

The server room plan feature was implemented with the following components:

- **Controller Method**: Added `server_room_plan` method in the MCoop controller
- **Template**: Created `coop/server_room_plan.tt` template with detailed server room proposal
- **URL Structure**: Accessible at `/mcoop/server_room_plan` and `/mcoop/server-room-plan` (for backward compatibility)

### 2. Menu Restructuring

To improve security and organization, the following menu changes were made:

- **Removed MCoop Menu**: The standalone MCoop menu item was removed from the top navigation
- **Admin Integration**: MCoop links were moved to the Admin menu and made accessible only to users with admin privileges
- **Conditional Display**: All MCoop-related links are now conditionally displayed based on user roles

### 3. Code Cleanup

Several code improvements were made:

- **Removed Duplicate Routes**: Eliminated duplicate route definitions in the Root controller
- **Simplified Controller Logic**: Streamlined the MCoop controller to focus on core functionality
- **Enhanced Security**: Restricted access to MCoop features to administrators only
- **Improved Template**: Removed redundant menu from the server room plan template

## Technical Details

### Controller Changes

The MCoop controller now has two methods for handling server room plan requests:

```perl
# Main method for server room plan
sub server_room_plan :Path('server_room_plan') :Args(0) {
    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    # Implementation details...
    $c->stash(template => 'coop/server_room_plan.tt');
    $c->forward($c->view('TT'));
}

# Compatibility method for hyphenated URLs
sub server_room_plan_hyphen :Path('server-room-plan') :Args(0) {
    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    $c->forward('server_room_plan');
}
```

### Template Structure

The server room plan template (`coop/server_room_plan.tt`) provides a detailed proposal including:

- Equipment requirements with pricing
- Options analysis for different server room configurations
- Common practices in server room implementation
- Recommendations for short-term and long-term solutions

### Menu Changes

The navigation menu was restructured by:

1. Removing the MCoop menu from `TopDropListCoop.tt`
2. Adding MCoop links to the Admin menu in `admintopmenu.tt`
3. Making the MCoop section in the Admin menu visible only to administrators

## Benefits

- **Improved Security**: MCoop administrative features are now properly restricted
- **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together in the Admin menu
- **Simplified Navigation**: Reduced menu clutter by consolidating related items
- **Consistent URL Structure**: Support for both underscore and hyphen formats

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing role-based access control for specific MCoop features
- Develop additional server infrastructure documentation
- Create a visual diagram of the server room layout

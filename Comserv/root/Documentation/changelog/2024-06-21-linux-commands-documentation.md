# Linux Commands Documentation Addition

**Date:** June 21, 2024  
**Author:** Shanta  
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

Added a comprehensive Linux commands reference guide for administrators. This documentation provides a collection of common commands for Ubuntu, Debian, and Proxmox systems that administrators may need for day-to-day operations, troubleshooting, and system maintenance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Linux Commands Reference Documentation

Created a new documentation file (`linux_commands.md`) in the admin roles directory that includes:

- System information commands
- File system operations
- Process management
- Package management (APT and DPKG)
- Network commands
- Service management (systemd)
- User management
- File searching
- Disk management
- Proxmox-specific commands
- Log file locations and viewing
- Compression and archiving
- System monitoring
- Firewall management (UFW)
- Troubleshooting commands
- Best practices

### 2. Updated Documentation Configuration

- Added the Linux commands documentation to the "admin_guides" category
- Added the file path to the default_paths section in the documentation configuration

## Benefits

1. **Improved Administrator Efficiency**: Provides quick access to commonly used commands without having to search online
2. **Standardized Command Reference**: Ensures all administrators use consistent commands and approaches
3. **Reduced Learning Curve**: Helps new administrators quickly learn essential commands
4. **Proxmox-Specific Commands**: Includes specialized commands for Proxmox virtualization management
5. **Troubleshooting Assistance**: Provides commands specifically for troubleshooting common issues

## Future Considerations

1. **Command Examples**: Add more specific examples for each command
2. **Server-Specific Commands**: Add commands specific to our server configurations
3. **Automation Scripts**: Include sample scripts for automating common tasks
4. **Interactive Elements**: Consider adding interactive elements to the documentation for command testing
5. **Regular Updates**: Establish a process for regularly updating the command reference as new tools and commands become relevant

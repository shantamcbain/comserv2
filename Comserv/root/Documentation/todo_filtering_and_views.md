## Technical Details

The implementation involved:

1. Enhancing the Todo controller to support filtering and different views
2. Creating a new month.tt template for the month view
3. Updating the day.tt and week.tt templates for consistency
4. Adding a filter panel to the todo.tt template

These changes make the Todo system more user-friendly and efficient, allowing users to quickly find and manage their todos based on various criteria.

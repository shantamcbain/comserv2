<h1>GitHub Projects Guide</h1>

<p>GitHub Projects is a project management tool built into GitHub. It integrates seamlessly with your GitHub repositories, making it easy to link tasks to issues and pull requests.</p>

<p>Here are some steps to get started with GitHub Projects:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Created an organization on GitHub named "computersystemconsulting".</li>
    <li>Go to your organization's page on GitHub and click on the "Projects" tab.</li>
    <li>Click on "New project" to create a new project board.</li>
    <li>Give your project a name and an optional description, then click "Create project".</li>
    <li>You can now add columns to your project board, such as "To do", "In progress", and "Done".</li>
    <li>To add a new task, click on the "+" button in a column and create a new card.</li>
    <li>You can move cards between columns by dragging and dropping them.</li>
    <li>Attempt to transfer the "CatalystComser1" repository from your personal account to the "computersystemconsulting" organization. (This step was not successful due to issues with the GitHub interface.)</li>
    <li>Next steps: Investigate alternative methods for transferring the repository to the organization, or consider creating a new repository within the organization and pushing your local code to this new repository.</li>
</ol>

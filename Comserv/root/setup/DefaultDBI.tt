[%# DefaultDBI.tt - Get DBI from the application context %]
[%# This file replaces the old DefaultDBI.tt that was setting up DBI directly %]
[%# Now we get the DBI from the Catalyst application context %]

[%# No need to set up DBI here as it's handled by the application %]
[%# The DBI connection is available through c.stash.dbi or c.model('DB') %]

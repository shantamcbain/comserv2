<p>On this site we will track the progress of the SunFire server.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have added your email to the script so You will be notified when a to do's etc are added to the application.</li>
  <li>When you log in next you will see an admin notes link. This will be the place for communication between us
  within the application. It opens a from that you can edit and save.</li>
  <li><p> I have added 3 new account packages g999, hosting, and reseller. All can be set to
  having a fixed IP assigned but as we don't have that fixed yet. we will have to add it later. </p></li>
  <li>
   <p>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Begin the creation of the g999 node sites. </h3> <p>My suggestion is to start with the ones that are not
  currently
  working.
  then move to moving the working sites over.</p>
  <h3>My reasoning is</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>We can get non producing nodes producing! </li>
     <li>We can test the ability to use one IP for multiple noses.</li>
     <li>We will be able to get a list of ports that need to be open.</li>
     <li> We can practice the process before moving working nodes.</li>
     <li>We get get a picture of the needed security to operate a node safely. A copy of the requirements should
     give us this information.</li>

    </ol>
    </li>
  <li>
   <h2>Fixed IP:</h2>
<p>Need to contact Telus again to continue this process. </p>
<h3>Questions to ask </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Can we attach an Ip to a
   virtual card?</li>
  <li> How are the Ports etc passed through to the nic? Is it done through the telus router or do we need to
   put a switch/router between Telus and the Telus router and our server. </li>
   <li>What device on the Telus side do we need to access the ips.</li>
   <li><h3>Possible Devices that we may need to interface between the server and Telus.</h3>

<h1>Honey Production</h1>

<p>Our honey is 100% pure, raw, and unfiltered, harvested from our healthy hives. Here's an overview of our honey production process:</p>

<h2>Honey Harvest</h2>
<p>We carefully harvest our honey at the peak of the nectar flow, when the honey is ripe and the flavor is at its best.</p>

<h2>Honey Extraction</h2>
<p>We use a centrifugal honey extractor to extract the honey from the frames, preserving the integrity of the honeycomb for future use by the bees.</p>

<h2>Honey Management</h2>
<p>After extraction, our honey is strained to remove any remaining wax particles, then stored in airtight containers to preserve its quality.</p>

<h2>Honey Production</h2>
<p>Our honey production practices are designed to ensure the health of our bees and the quality of our honey. We never over-harvest or feed our bees sugar syrup to replace the honey we've taken.</p>

## Overview

Comserv is a comprehensive Catalyst-based web application for managing various aspects of business operations, including project management, documentation, and site administration.



## Key Features

- Project Management System

- Documentation System

- Todo Management

- Site Administration

- User Management

- Theme System



## Documentation

All documentation is located in the `Comserv/root/Documentation` directory. The documentation is accessible through the application's Documentation controller.



For developers and administrators, please refer to the documentation within the application for:

- Project Management System

- Documentation System

- Theme System

- Controller and Model documentation

- Installation and configuration guides



## Recent Updates

- Fixed project creation issue where 'group_of_poster' was being set to null

- Improved error handling and logging throughout the application

- Enhanced theme system with better organization and customization options



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies using `cpanm --installdeps .` or run the server script which will install dependencies automatically

3. Configure your database settings in `db_config.json` (see Documentation/general/database_connection.md for details)

4. Start the application with `perl Comserv/script/comserv_server.pl`



## Development Guidelines

- All documentation should be placed in the `Comserv/root/Documentation` directory

- Use .tt template files for documentation rather than .md files

- All CSS should be part of the theme system (located in `Comserv/root/static/css/themes/`)

- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions

- Use the scripts in the `Comserv/script` directory for common development tasks



## Important Notes for Developers

- When working with documentation, prefer .tt files over .md files

- When both .tt and .md files exist for the same content, merge the content into the .tt file and remove the .md file

- Always check for existing files before creating new ones to avoid duplication

- All CSS should be managed through the theme system rather than in individual files

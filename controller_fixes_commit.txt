Fix controller loading issues and package definition problems

This commit addresses several issues that were preventing the application from starting properly:

1. Fixed package definition in Hosting.pm (was incorrectly defined as ProxyManager)
2. Removed duplicate subroutine definitions in Project.pm (enhance_project_data and build_project_tree)
3. Updated ThemeEditor.pm to use Class::C3 instead of deprecated NEXT module
4. Added proper package definition to ThemeAdmin/update_theme_with_variables.pm
5. Modified ProxyManager.pm and Hosting.pm to handle missing NPM_API_KEY environment variable gracefully

These changes allow the application to start without errors while maintaining all functionality.
Added documentation file (2024-08-controller-fixes.md) with details about the changes.

Resolves issues:
- "Package is not defined" errors
- Redefined subroutine warnings
- NEXT deprecation warnings
- Environment variable requirement errors

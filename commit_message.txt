[Cleanup] Remove unnecessary files from application root

- Removed all "Formatting title from:" files that were incorrectly created
- Removed all "Added ... to ... category" files that were incorrectly created
- Cleaned up empty directory entries that were created without permission
- No functional changes to the application code

These files were created by an AI assistant without proper permission and
were cluttering the application root directory. This cleanup improves the
repository organization and makes it easier to navigate the codebase.

This change is ready for deployment to the production server.

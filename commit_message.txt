Fix database connection DSN format and add documentation

This commit fixes database connection issues by correcting the DSN (Data Source Name) format in multiple database model files. The changes ensure proper MySQL connectivity throughout the application.

Changes include:

1. Fixed DSN format in DBEncy.pm to use the correct MySQL connection string format
2. Fixed DSN format in DBForager.pm for consistency
3. Fixed DSN format in RemoteDB.pm to ensure proper remote database connections
4. Fixed DSN format in DBSchemaManager.pm for schema initialization
5. Added db_type field to database configurations in db_config.json
6. Added remote_connections section to db_config.json for remote database access
7. Added comprehensive documentation on database connection configuration

The primary issue was that the DSN string was missing the proper database driver prefix, causing errors like:
"Can't connect to data source 'dbi::dbname=ency;host=localhost;port=3306' because I can't work out what driver to use"

The correct format for MySQL connections is now used consistently:
"dbi:mysql:database=DATABASE_NAME;host=HOST;port=PORT"

This fix ensures that all database models in the application can properly connect to their respective databases.

Update Documentation System documentation with template refactoring details

This commit updates the Documentation System documentation to reflect the refactoring of the index.tt template file into modular components.

Key changes:
- Added new section about modular template structure
- Updated Technical Implementation section with information about template refactoring
- Added details about category-specific template files
- Added information about shared components and benefits of modular structure
- Updated Last Updated date to April 7, 2025

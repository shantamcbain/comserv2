## FILE MODIFICATION POLICY



**⚠️ WARNING: NEVER REPLACE OR MODIFY EXISTING FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION ⚠️**



All AI assistants working with this codebase must adhere to the following rules:



1. **ALWAYS ASK FOR PERMISSION** before modifying, replacing, or deleting any existing file

2. **NEVER ASSUME** that a file can be overwritten, even if it appears to have issues

3. **PROPOSE CHANGES** rather than implementing them directly

4. **EXPLAIN THE IMPACT** of any proposed changes before making them



## Specific Guidelines for the Comserv System



### File and Package Naming



- Ensure that Perl module filenames match their package declarations

- Example: A file named `Documentation.pm` should contain the package `Comserv::Controller::Documentation`



### Known Issues



- The Documentation controller has a filename/package mismatch:

  - File: `Documantation.pm` (with an 'a')

  - Package: `Comserv::Controller::Documentation` (with an 'o')

  - This causes route failures for `/documentation` and `/Documentation`



### Logging Requirements



Always use the `log_with_details` method for comprehensive logging:



```perl

$self->logging->log_with_details($c, 'info', __FILE__, __LINE__, 'method_name',

    "Detailed message with relevant information");

```

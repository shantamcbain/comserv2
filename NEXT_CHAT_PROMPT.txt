**CRITICAL**: Read /home/shanta/PycharmProjects/comserv2/Comserv/root/Documentation/AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.tt first for context and constraints.

**TASK**: Complete HybridDB Backend Integration for Database Mode Switching

**PROBLEM**: The /admin/database_mode route is now FIXED and working, but the backend switching is NOT fully integrated. When users switch to SQLite mode:
- HybridDB model tracks the selection (mysql vs sqlite) 
- But other models (like Todo) still connect to MySQL
- The switch doesn't actually change database connections for data models

**WHAT WAS COMPLETED**:
✅ Fixed /database_mode route - Added proper route in Admin controller at /admin/database_mode
✅ Updated all menu links from /database_mode to /admin/database_mode in navigation templates
✅ Made DatabaseMode controller methods :Private - proper admin organization
✅ Clean architecture - No more Root.pm clutter

**CRITICAL ISSUE TO SOLVE**:
⚠️ **HybridDB Integration Incomplete**: The HybridDB backend switching needs to be integrated with data models so that when SQLite mode is selected, models like Todo actually use SQLite instead of MySQL.

**SPECIFIC TASKS NEEDED**:
1. **Integrate HybridDB with data models** - Make Todo/other models check HybridDB for connection info
2. **Test the /admin/database_mode route** - Verify it works properly in browser
3. **Complete backend switching** - Ensure SQLite mode actually uses SQLite data
4. **Verify data persistence** - Test that data switches properly between backends

**KEY FILES TO EXAMINE**:
- `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Model/HybridDB.pm` - Backend selection tracking
- `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Controller/Todo.pm` - Example model that needs integration
- `Comserv/lib/Comserv/Controller/DatabaseMode.pm` - Database mode controller
- `Comserv/root/database_mode/index.tt` - Frontend interface

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Use existing database connection methods when possible
- Test within application context (not standalone scripts)
- Focus on implementation first, ask for specific files only when needed

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- When user switches to SQLite mode, Todo data comes from SQLite
- When user switches to MySQL mode, Todo data comes from MySQL  
- Backend switching persists across sessions
- No data corruption during switching

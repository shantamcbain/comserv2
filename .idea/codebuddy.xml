        <option value="We are installing our catalyst application for the first time We have created a install_comserv script That has Gone as far as getting all the perl and catalyst requirements taken care of. our problem here is I would like to move into the catalyst application to deal with chosing the  database type. sql or file. Right now the application runs only on mysql as a result the code fails when as the there is no database setup yet. What options do we have to do this?  Please start from the point of pulling the software from github. " />
        <option value="We are have ing a problem here with the way we are accessing the databases. our primary route in is the use of a json file to keep all dbi information out of the software itself but In the process of attempting to change the database access to db server instad of local I have unearthed a point in the application that exposes the dbi information into the code that is versioned. That vilolation of security is in DefaultDBI.tt which was crated in a vary early version of the software to be able to create link list, mostily in the menu code, from table entries.  the code was forgoten after figoring out how to do this from the application and not in the tt.  We need to refractor the code to remove the use of the dbif out of the code" />

        <option value="you should read omserv/root/Documentation/AI_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.tt before tackling any task and update it as we learn how to work the application.&#10;when fixing a problem read the documentation for the module being worked on the code for the module and recored the diffrences in the documentation for developing a plan to remove the diffrences.&#10;I beleive the use of .tt format for all documentation is in the guidlines. I may be wise to add guidelines that would allow you to convert md documentation to .tt as you find it.&#10;The overall goal is to bring documentation and the code in to sync. Help coders and the ai to fallow the plan in the documentation. (the only part of the system that can take the future into each sessiong.)&#10;" />
        <option value="yes we need to need to implement the protocal for nerrowing the gap between the the code and the documentation / a plan to convert md formataed code to tt formate in all documentation." />
        <option value="How do we make sure scripts get remoed when done with I sl more gardual, convert all files with md format as you read it. When tacling a problem you should read the guidle lines which tell you to avoid the us of pl file that have a greate chance of intorducing error sin the code. and they have to be deleted making code maaintainace and comiting a real problem" />
        <option value="lets just add to the quidelines that if you read documention in md format to convert it to tt format." />
        <option value="yes" />
        <option value="Please look at the changes in the application since the last commit and make sure the documentaion mataches the changes in the code." />
        <option value="I just last commit. Not sure the difrence between base line tag and head~1, use the .tt format already in use. I a files is in .md convert it to .tt. The goal is with each documentation up date the ducumentation becomes closer to what the code, gives developers, admin, ai and users a better understanding of what the code dose, how to change it and how to use it. Spasific to the leavel of the user. It should also include the plan for implenting the changes to acheave the goal of the application. Documentation should show what we want to do, were we are at, how we are going to get the and improvemnts to add in future updates." />
        <option value="Please continue with the plan. There are two things that occured in your todo_documentation_plan.tt&#10;one, thought not mentioned In the guidelines, is there need to be a short line at the top of the page so the page vesion is visible in the ide&#10; 2. this file, being in .md format will not be readable in the browser.&#10;other wise we can continue with the plan to update the documentation for the changes. which would be phase 1" />
        <option value="Please continue with the plan." />
        <option value="we keep getting warnings about over writing files. Why is the pach being applied in this mannor?" />
        <option value="lest continue with the plan" />
        <option value="Please rember that in this session we are working on getting the documentation in line with the code changes and overall plan so we can make a commit and move documentation changes out of main branch into Documentation." />
        <option value="I thought we had a plan to do this already." />
        <option value="Are we going to get to the plan of getting the documentation in sync with both the code changes and the future plans for the code changes. Or are you going to wast time modifying the Documentation contorller with no changes. It is the documentation that should be changeing." />
        <option value="We are just working on the growing list in this session allong of not updated and commeted documentation for the code that has been change since the last commit. I you could rember the plan this would be easy instead of creating an new and diffrent plan on each prompt. &#10;sync means if the code has change and the fuction is diffrent thatn the documentation the documentation needs updateing. The goal of documentation is to show users what the plan for the code is, state the code in that plan, what future changes need to be made to suceed in the plan, Sugested improvments to the code/plan, and have how to use the code based on the user role. " />
        <option value="Automated may be a good idea to add to imporvement. right now we have enought to do to get the document in sync with what has been done since the last commit. Yes we need to lock in a sync plan so we are not working on so much on each change in the code leading to a commit.&#10;Your plan sound like a sound one the problem is keeping on the plan from prompt to prompt. which has alway been a problem with the codebudy interface. Thus the reason why documentation is so important to keep on track from prompt to promt.&#10;please continue with the plan" />
        <option value="Why do you inssist on destroying .tt files with md format. I makes it unreadable in the browser and in the ide. This point is part of the plan that you need to remember. othwise we waste a day of programing fixing your resusal to fallow the plan." />
        <option value="What is the use of .pl files that work outside the application. Are you not supposed to do the edits?" />
        <option value="r data integrity, so changes should be deliberate, version-controlled, and well-documented. If you’re asking whether you should edit them directly, the safer path is to treat them as part of a controlled workflow: inventory and classification, then decide whether to modify existing scripts, add new shared modules for reuse, or migrate logic into the application codebase where appropriate. Also consider centralizing similar tasks under the app’s script or library directories to reduce drift and confusion. &#10;These files are not version-contoled and not documents at all for the most part. and my be a plan for the future when the documentation is allined with the code. for now it is not a good idea to use them as I would rather you edit the files and give me the +- format so I can see the changes as they happen not all at once with an untested script. It the script was inside the application with role back etc then it may have value in the long term running of the application. for now lets edit the files as we go so I can see the logic you are applying to the code." />
        <option value="[% META title = 'AI Assistant Guidelines for Comserv System' %]&#10;should be at the top of the file. to move the code down one line so the file path can be seen.&#10;The documentation files have not been converted from .md to .tt format as asked for so I did not use most of you edits. When you edit a file that has .md format that is a .tt file it MUST be converted to .tt format. lets try again to get some code edited." />
        <option value="the plan tell you to do than as they are needed. PLEASE fallow the plan. If you have to keep on track read the plan on each prompt so you know what the plan is from prompt to prompt." />
        <option value="yes there is a dead line I whant to commit as soon as posible which cant be done till the files changes are in sync with the documentation as explained in each prompt and the plan if you would read and fallow it." />
        <option value="lets get the documentation in sync so we can commit the changes." />
        <option value="You KNOW the documents to do. THOSE THAT REQUIRE CHANGES DUE TO CODE CHANGES " />
        <option value="You are not getting to the point of reading the code changes and updating the documentation as the plan you created but refuse to fallow you wasted yet another prompt." />
        <option value="Please read the open file and start the process of doing the plan. Try to remember the plan so you can do it when I approve it " />
        <option value="Did you read the file I gave you It has a plan Please fallow it " />
        <option value="I am not seeing in your plan the plan to get the documentation in sync with the changes in the code. I would like to get the documentation in sync with the code encureing the it reflects the current step the code. How do I turn of the constate aproval that causes you to lose the plan and create yet another one." />
        <option value=".Lets go for batch so we don't lose the plan in promts." />
        <option value="The plan is about looking at the code and changeing the documentation to match the code changes. without losing the plan in the Documentation No new code is needed. At the most conversin of the dreded .md format in .tt files." />
        <option value="Most frustrating The plan in the file was to sync all code changes from the last commit so the code that was changed documentation is in sync. So that unfortunatly is a large batch but if you fallowed the plan it would not have had unessesary code change added to the list. " />
        <option value="No changes were made to any file even the one that was in the .md format was not changed Do you know the plan and what were are doing. If so why are you not fallowing it." />
        <option value="proced with the plan but this time actualy make change to the files that you returned NONE of the files in that returen had been modified" />
        <option value="is there something I can do to get you to stop making plans you don't fallow and get to reading the code change and changeing the documentation to show the current state of the code?" />
        <option value="no i don't want you modify code I what you to improve the dosumentation So the only files you will edit are the .tt files NOT .pm files. Every time you make a new plan you don't even remember it to the next prompt." />
        <option value="You are just giving me another plan and not working on the existing plan. Time to move on to a more cooperative ai that can remember the plan and fallow that plan." />
        <option value="if you actualy read the documentation and the guidelines you whould know that we droped the hybrid documentation style as it confuses the AI in any interface on how documentation is being done. so If i where to allow this deviation to the plan it would futher confuse documentation insted of reducing confusiong. Why I need to see all code changes and be able to edit cod changes." />
        <option value="we have a plan we just need to you to fallow it." />
        <option value="I have just checked three branches for the dispaly of our documentation main which basicly has a broken index page. The Documentatioin branch is  an old view of the system dispite haveing main merged into it. the pages branch also having the main merged into it Has the best version of the page for apperance to match the theme of the site There are lots of other diffrences mostly realted to dispiet having main merged into the other branches the old brach setting our ovriding the currnt main branch setting. Is this normal? How do we fix the issures &#10;" />

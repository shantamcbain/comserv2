.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Tainted data is data that comes from an unsafe source, such as the
command line, or, in the case of web apps, any GET or POST transactions.
Read the perlsec man page for details on why tainted data is bad,
and how to untaint the data.
.PP
When you're writing unit tests for code that deals with tainted data,
you'll want to have a way to provide tainted data for your routines to
handle, and easy ways to check and report on the taintedness of your data,
in standard Test::More style.
.ie n .SH """Test::More""\-style Functions"
.el .SH "\f(CWTest::More\fP\-style Functions"
.IX Header "Test::More-style Functions"
All the \f(CWxxx_ok()\fR functions work like standard \f(CW\*(C`Test::More\*(C'\fR\-style
functions, where the last parm is an optional message, it outputs ok or
not ok, and returns a boolean telling if the test passed.
.SS "taint_checking_ok( [$message] )"
.IX Subsection "taint_checking_ok( [$message] )"
Test::More\-style test that taint checking is on.  This should probably
be the first thing in any \fI*.t\fR file that deals with taintedness.
.ie n .SS "tainted_ok( $var [, $message ] )"
.el .SS "tainted_ok( \f(CW$var\fP [, \f(CW$message\fP ] )"
.IX Subsection "tainted_ok( $var [, $message ] )"
Checks that \fR\f(CI$var\fR\fI\fR is tainted.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    tainted_ok( $ENV{FOO} );
.Ve
.ie n .SS "untainted_ok( $var [, $message ] )"
.el .SS "untainted_ok( \f(CW$var\fP [, \f(CW$message\fP ] )"
.IX Subsection "untainted_ok( $var [, $message ] )"
Checks that \fR\f(CI$var\fR\fI\fR is not tainted.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $foo = my_validate( $ENV{FOO} );
\&    untainted_ok( $foo );
.Ve
.ie n .SS "tainted_ok_deeply( $var [, $message ] )"
.el .SS "tainted_ok_deeply( \f(CW$var\fP [, \f(CW$message\fP ] )"
.IX Subsection "tainted_ok_deeply( $var [, $message ] )"
Checks that \fR\f(CI$var\fR\fI\fR is tainted.  If \fI\fR\f(CI$var\fR\fI\fR
is a reference, it recursively checks every
variable to make sure they are all tainted.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    tainted_ok_deeply( \e%ENV );
.Ve
.ie n .SS "untainted_ok_deeply( $var [, $message ] )"
.el .SS "untainted_ok_deeply( \f(CW$var\fP [, \f(CW$message\fP ] )"
.IX Subsection "untainted_ok_deeply( $var [, $message ] )"
Checks that \fR\f(CI$var\fR\fI\fR is not tainted.  If \fI\fR\f(CI$var\fR\fI\fR
is a reference, it recursively checks every
variable to make sure they are all not tainted.

.SH "Helper Functions"
.IX Header "Helper Functions"
These are all helper functions.  Most are wrapped by an \f(CWxxx_ok()\fR
counterpart, except for \f(CW\*(C`taint\*(C'\fR which actually does something, instead
of just reporting it.
.SS \fBtaint_checking()\fP
.IX Subsection "taint_checking()"
Returns true if taint checking is enabled via the \-T flag.
.ie n .SS "tainted( \fI\fP\fI$var\fP\fI\fP )"
.el .SS "tainted( \fI\fP\f(CI$var\fP\fI\fP )"
.IX Subsection "tainted( $var )"
Returns boolean saying if \f(CW$var\fR is tainted.
.ie n .SS "tainted_deeply( \fI\fP\fI$var\fP\fI\fP )"
.el .SS "tainted_deeply( \fI\fP\f(CI$var\fP\fI\fP )"
.IX Subsection "tainted_deeply( $var )"
Returns boolean saying if \f(CW$var\fR is tainted.  If
\&\f(CW$var\fR is a reference it recursively checks every
variable to make sure they are all tainted.
.ie n .SS "taint( @list )"
.el .SS "taint( \f(CW@list\fP )"
.IX Subsection "taint( @list )"
Marks each (apparently) taintable argument in \fR\f(CI@list\fR\fI\fR as being tainted.
.PP
References can be tainted like any other scalar, but it doesn't make
sense to, so they will \fBnot\fR be tainted by this function.
.PP
Some \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fRd and magical variables may fail to be tainted by this routine,
try as it may.
.ie n .SS "taint_deeply( @list )"
.el .SS "taint_deeply( \f(CW@list\fP )"
.IX Subsection "taint_deeply( @list )"
Similar to \f(CW\*(C`taint\*(C'\fR, except that if any elements in \fR\f(CI@list\fR\fI\fR are
references, it walks deeply into the data structure and marks each
taintable argument as being tainted.
.PP
If any variables are \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fRd this will taint all the scalars within
the tied object.

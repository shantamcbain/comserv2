.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides Windows-specific implementations for determining
common user directories.  In normal usage this module will always be
used via File::HomeDir.
.PP
Internally this module will use Win32::GetFolderPath to fetch the location
of your directories. As a result of this, in certain unusual situations
(usually found inside large organizations) the methods may return UNC paths
such as \f(CW\*(C`\e\ecifs.local\ehome$\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If your application runs on Windows and you want to have it work comprehensively
everywhere, you may need to implement your own handling for these paths as they
can cause strange behaviour.
.PP
For example, stat calls to UNC paths may work but block for several seconds, but
\&\fBopendir()\fR may not be able to read any files (creating the appearance of an existing
but empty directory).
.PP
To avoid complicating the problem any further, in the rare situation that a UNC path
is returned by \f(CW\*(C`GetFolderPath\*(C'\fR the usual \-d validation checks will \fBnot\fR be done.

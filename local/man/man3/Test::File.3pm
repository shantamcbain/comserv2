.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This modules provides a collection of test utilities for file
attributes.
.PP
Some file attributes depend on the owner of the process testing the
file in the same way the file test operators do.  For instance, root
(or super-user or Administrator) may always be able to read files no
matter the permissions.
.PP
Some attributes don't make sense outside of Unix, either, so some
tests automatically skip if they think they won't work on the
platform.  If you have a way to make these functions work on Windows,
for instance, please send me a patch. :) If you want to pretend to be
Windows on a non-Windows machine (for instance, to test \f(CWskip()\fR),
you can set the \f(CW\*(C`PRETEND_TO_BE_WINDOWS\*(C'\fR environment variable.
.PP
The optional NAME parameter for every function allows you to specify a
name for the test.  If not supplied, a reasonable default will be
generated.
.SS Functions
.IX Subsection "Functions"
.IP has_symlinks 4
.IX Item "has_symlinks"
Returns true is this module thinks that the current system supports
symlinks.

.IP "file_empty_ok( FILENAME [, NAME ] )" 4
.IX Item "file_empty_ok( FILENAME [, NAME ] )"
Ok if the file exists and has empty size, not ok if the file does not
exist or exists with non-zero size.
.Sp

this will fail if the argument is not a plain file or is a directory.
.IP "file_size_ok( FILENAME, SIZE [, NAME ]  )" 4
.IX Item "file_size_ok( FILENAME, SIZE [, NAME ] )"
Ok if the file exists and has SIZE size in bytes (exactly), not ok if

Ok if the file exists and has size less than or equal to MAX bytes, not
ok if the file does not exist or exists with size greater than MAX
bytes.
.Sp
Previously this tried to test any sort of file. Sometime in the future
this will fail if the argument is not a plain file or is a directory.
.IP "file_min_size_ok( FILENAME, MIN [, NAME ] )" 4
.IX Item "file_min_size_ok( FILENAME, MIN [, NAME ] )"
Ok if the file exists and has size greater than or equal to MIN bytes,
not ok if the file does not exist or exists with size less than MIN
bytes.
.Sp
Previously this tried to test any sort of file. Sometime in the future
this will fail if the argument is not a plain file or is a directory.
.IP "file_line_count_is( FILENAME, COUNT [, NAME ]  )" 4
.IX Item "file_line_count_is( FILENAME, COUNT [, NAME ] )"
Ok if the file exists and has COUNT lines (exactly), not ok if the
file does not exist or exists with a line count other than COUNT.
.Sp
This function uses the current value of \f(CW$/\fR as the line ending and
counts the lines by reading them and counting how many it read.
.Sp
Previously this tried to test any sort of file. Sometime in the future
this will fail if the argument is not a plain file or is a directory.
.IP "file_line_count_isnt( FILENAME, COUNT [, NAME ]  )" 4
.IX Item "file_line_count_isnt( FILENAME, COUNT [, NAME ] )"
Ok if the file exists and doesn't have exactly COUNT lines, not ok if
the file does not exist or exists with a line count of COUNT. Read
that carefully: the file must exist for this test to pass!
.Sp
This function uses the current value of \f(CW$/\fR as the line ending and
counts the lines by reading them and counting how many it read.
.Sp
Previously this tried to test any sort of file. Sometime in the future
this will fail if the argument is not a plain file or is a directory.

.IX Item "file_line_count_between( FILENAME, MIN, MAX, [, NAME ] )"
Ok if the file exists and has a line count between MIN and MAX,
inclusively.
.Sp
This function uses the current value of \f(CW$/\fR as the line ending and
counts the lines by reading them and counting how many it read.
.Sp
Previously this tried to test any sort of file. Sometime in the future
this will fail if the argument is not a plain file or is a directory.
.IP "file_contains_like ( FILENAME, PATTERN [, NAME ] )" 4
.IX Item "file_contains_like ( FILENAME, PATTERN [, NAME ] )"
Ok if the file exists and its contents (as one big string) match
PATTERN, not ok if the file does not exist, is not readable, or exists
but doesn't match PATTERN.
.Sp
Since the file contents are read into memory, you should not use this
for large files.  Besides memory consumption, test diagnostics for
failing tests might be difficult to decipher.  However, for short
files this works very well.
.Sp
Because the entire contents are treated as one large string, you can
make a pattern that tests multiple lines.  Don't forget that you may
need to use the /s modifier for such patterns:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # make sure file has one or more paragraphs with CSS class X
\&        file_contains_like($html_file, qr{<p class="X">.*?</p>}s);
.Ve
.Sp
Contrariwise, if you need to match at the beginning or end of a line
inside the file, use the /m modifier:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # make sure file has a setting for foo
\&        file_contains_like($config_file, qr/^ foo \es* = \es* \ew+ $/mx);
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to test your file contents against multiple patterns, but
don't want to have the file read in repeatedly, you can pass an
arrayref of patterns instead of a single pattern, like so:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        # make sure our template has rendered correctly
\&        file_contains_like($template_out,
\&                [
\&                qr/^ $title_line $/mx,
\&                map { qr/^ $_ $/mx } @chapter_headings,
\&                qr/^ $footer_line $/mx,
\&                ]);
.Ve
.Sp
Please note that if you do this, and your file does not exist or is
not readable, you'll only get one test failure instead of a failure
for each pattern.  This could cause your test plan to be off, although
you may not care at that point because your test failed anyway.  If
you do care, either skip the test plan altogether by employing
Test::More's \f(CWdone_testing()\fR function, or use
"file_readable_ok" in conjunction with a \f(CW\*(C`SKIP\*(C'\fR block.

.IP "file_contains_unlike ( FILENAME, PATTERN [, NAME ] )" 4
.IX Item "file_contains_unlike ( FILENAME, PATTERN [, NAME ] )"

match PATTERN, not ok if the file does not exist, is not readable, or
exists but matches PATTERN.
.Sp

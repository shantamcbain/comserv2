Mixin::Linewise \- write your linewise code for handles; this does the rest

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
It's boring to deal with opening files for IO, converting strings to
handle-like objects, and all that.  With Mixin::Linewise::Readers and
Mixin::Linewise::Writers, you can just write a method to handle handles, and
methods for handling strings and filenames are added for you.
.SH "PERL VERSION"
.IX Header "PERL VERSION"
This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from
the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl released
in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most recently released
version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)
.PP
Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower
the minimum required perl.

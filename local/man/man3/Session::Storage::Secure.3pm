.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module implements a secure way to encode session data.  It is primarily
intended for storing session data in browser cookies, but could be used with
other backend storage where security of stored session data is important.
.PP
Features include:
.IP \(bu 4
Data serialization and compression using Sereal
.IP \(bu 4
Data encryption using AES with a unique derived key per encoded session
.IP \(bu 4
Enforced expiration timestamp (optional)
.IP \(bu 4
Integrity protected with a message authentication code (MAC)
.PP
The storage protocol used in this module is based heavily on
A Secure Cookie Protocol <http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/Cookie_COMNET.pdf>
by Alex Liu and others.  Liu proposes a session cookie value as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  user|expiration|E(data,k)|HMAC(user|expiration|data|ssl\-key,k)
\&
\&  where
\&
\&    | denotes concatenation with a separator character
\&    E(p,q) is a symmetric encryption of p with key q
\&    HMAC(p,q) is a keyed message hash of p with key q
\&    k is HMAC(user|expiration, sk)
\&    sk is a secret key shared by all servers
\&    ssl\-key is an SSL session key
.Ve
.PP
Because SSL session keys are not readily available (and SSL termination
may happen prior to the application server), we omit \f(CW\*(C`ssl\-key\*(C'\fR.  This
weakens protection against replay attacks if an attacker can break
the SSL session key and intercept messages.
.PP
Using \f(CW\*(C`user\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`expiration\*(C'\fR to generate the encryption and MAC keys was a
method proposed to ensure unique keys to defeat volume attacks against the
secret key.  Rather than rely on those for uniqueness (with the unfortunate
side effect of revealing user names and prohibiting anonymous sessions), we
replace \f(CW\*(C`user\*(C'\fR with a cryptographically-strong random salt value.
.PP
The original proposal also calculates a MAC based on unencrypted data.  We
instead calculate the MAC based on the encrypted data.  This avoids an extra
step decrypting invalid messages.  Because the salt is already encoded into the
key, we omit it from the MAC input.
.PP
Therefore, the session storage protocol used by this module is as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  salt|expiration|E(data,k)|HMAC(expiration|E(data,k),k)
\&
\&  where
\&
\&    | denotes concatenation with a separator character
\&    E(p,q) is a symmetric encryption of p with key q
\&    HMAC(p,q) is a keyed message hash of p with key q
\&    k is HMAC(salt, sk)
\&    sk is a secret key shared by all servers
.Ve
.PP
The salt value is generated using Math::Random::ISAAC::XS, seeded from
Crypt::URandom.
.PP
The HMAC algorithm is \f(CW\*(C`hmac_sha256\*(C'\fR from Digest::SHA.  Encryption
is done by Crypt::CBC using Crypt::Rijndael (AES).  The ciphertext and
MAC's in the cookie are Base64 encoded by MIME::Base64 by default.
.PP
During session retrieval, if the MAC does not authenticate or if the expiration
is set and in the past, the session will be discarded.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
.SS "secret_key (required)"
.IX Subsection "secret_key (required)"
This is used to secure the session data.  The encryption and message
authentication key is derived from this using a one-way function.  Changing it
will invalidate all sessions.
.SS default_duration
.IX Subsection "default_duration"
Number of seconds for which the session may be considered valid.  If an
expiration is not provided to \f(CW\*(C`encode\*(C'\fR, this is used instead to expire the
session after a period of time.  It is unset by default, meaning that session
expiration is not capped.
.SS old_secrets
.IX Subsection "old_secrets"
An optional array reference of strings containing old secret keys no longer
used for encryption but still supported for decrypting session data.
.SS separator
.IX Subsection "separator"
A character used to separate fields.  It defaults to \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR.
.SS sereal_encoder_options
.IX Subsection "sereal_encoder_options"
A hash reference with constructor arguments for Sereal::Encoder. Defaults
to \f(CW\*(C`{ snappy => 1, croak_on_bless => 1 }\*(C'\fR.
.SS sereal_decoder_options
.IX Subsection "sereal_decoder_options"
A hash reference with constructor arguments for Sereal::Decoder. Defaults
to \f(CW\*(C`{ refuse_objects => 1, validate_utf8  => 1 }\*(C'\fR.
.SS transport_encoder
.IX Subsection "transport_encoder"
A code reference to convert binary data elements (the encrypted data and the
MAC) into a transport-safe form.  Defaults to
MIME::Base64::encode_base64url.  The output must not include
the \f(CW\*(C`separator\*(C'\fR attribute used to delimit fields.
.SS transport_decoder
.IX Subsection "transport_decoder"
A code reference to extract binary data (the encrypted data and the
MAC) from a transport-safe form.  It must be the complement to \f(CW\*(C`encode\*(C'\fR.
Defaults to MIME::Base64::decode_base64url.
.SS protocol_version
.IX Subsection "protocol_version"
An integer representing the protocol used by \f(CW\*(C`Session::Storage::Secure\*(C'\fR.
Protocol 1 was the initial version, which used a now-deprecated mode of
Crypt::CBC.  Protocol 2 is the current default.
.SH METHODS
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS encode
.IX Subsection "encode"
.Vb 1
\&  my $string = $store\->encode( $data, $expires );
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW$data\fR argument should be a reference to a data structure.  By default,
it must not contain objects.  (See "Objects not stored by default" for
rationale and alternatives.) If it is undefined, an empty hash reference will
be encoded instead.
.PP
The optional \f(CW$expires\fR argument should be the session expiration time
expressed as epoch seconds.  If the \f(CW$expires\fR time is in the past, the
\&\f(CW$data\fR argument is cleared and an empty hash reference is encoded and returned.
If no \f(CW$expires\fR is given, then if the \f(CW\*(C`default_duration\*(C'\fR attribute is set, it
will be used to calculate an expiration time.
.PP
The method returns a string that securely encodes the session data.  All binary
components are protected via the "transport_encoder" attribute.
.PP
An exception is thrown on any errors.
.SS decode
.IX Subsection "decode"
.Vb 1
\&  my $data = $store\->decode( $string );
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW$string\fR argument must be the output of \f(CW\*(C`encode\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If the message integrity check fails or if expiration exists and is in
the past, the method returns undef or an empty list (depending on context).
.PP
An exception is thrown on any errors.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.IX Header "LIMITATIONS"
.SS "Secret key"
.IX Subsection "Secret key"
You must protect the secret key, of course.  Rekeying periodically would
improve security.  Rekeying also invalidates all existing sessions unless the
\&\f(CW\*(C`old_secrets\*(C'\fR attribute contains old encryption keys still used for
decryption.  In a multi-node application, all nodes must share the same secret
key.
.SS "Session size"
.IX Subsection "Session size"
If storing the encoded session in a cookie, keep in mind that cookies must fit
within 4k, so don't store too much data.  This module uses Sereal for
serialization and enables the \f(CW\*(C`snappy\*(C'\fR compression option.  Sereal plus Snappy
appears to be one of the fastest and most compact serialization options for
Perl, according to the
Sereal benchmarks <https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/wiki/Sereal-Comparison-Graphs>
page.
.PP
However, nothing prevents the encoded output from exceeding 4k.  Applications
must check for this condition and handle it appropriately with an error or
by splitting the value across multiple cookies.
.SS "Objects not stored by default"
.IX Subsection "Objects not stored by default"
The default Sereal options do not allow storing objects because object
deserialization can have undesirable side effects, including potentially fatal
errors if a class is not available at deserialization time or if internal class
structures changed from when the session data was serialized to when it was
deserialized.  Applications should take steps to deflate/inflate objects before
storing them in session data.
.PP
Alternatively, applications can change "sereal_encoder_options" and
"sereal_decoder_options" to allow object serialization or other object
transformations and accept the risks of doing so.
.SH SECURITY
.IX Header "SECURITY"
Storing encrypted session data within a browser cookie avoids latency and
overhead of backend session storage, but has several additional security
considerations.
.SS "Transport security"
.IX Subsection "Transport security"
If using cookies to store session data, an attacker could intercept cookies and
replay them to impersonate a valid user regardless of encryption.  SSL
encryption of the transport channel is strongly recommended.
.SS "Cookie replay"
.IX Subsection "Cookie replay"
Because all session state is maintained in the session cookie, an attacker
or malicious user could replay an old cookie to return to a previous state.
Cookie-based sessions should not be used for recording incremental steps
in a transaction or to record "negative rights".
.PP
Because cookie expiration happens on the client-side, an attacker or malicious
user could replay a cookie after its scheduled expiration date.  It is strongly
recommended to set \f(CW\*(C`cookie_duration\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`default_duration\*(C'\fR to limit the window of
opportunity for such replay attacks.
.SS "Session authentication"
.IX Subsection "Session authentication"
A compromised secret key could be used to construct valid messages appearing to
be from any user.  Applications should take extra steps in their use of session
data to ensure that sessions are authenticated to the user.
.PP
One simple approach could be to store a hash of the user's hashed password
in the session on login and to verify it on each request.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  # on login
\&  my $hashed_pw = bcrypt( $password, $salt );
\&  if ( $hashed_pw eq $hashed_pw_from_db ) {
\&    session user => $user;
\&    session auth => bcrypt( $hashed_pw, $salt ) );
\&  }
\&
\&  # on each request
\&  if ( bcrypt( $hashed_pw_from_db, $salt ) ne session("auth") ) {
\&    context\->destroy_session;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The downside of this is that if there is a read-only attack against the
database (SQL injection or leaked backup dump) and the secret key is compromised,
then an attacker can forge a cookie to impersonate any user.
.PP
A more secure approach suggested by Stephen Murdoch in
Hardened Stateless Session Cookies <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/protocols08cookies.pdf>
is to store an iterated hash of the hashed password in the
database and use the hashed password itself within the session.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  # on login
\&  my $hashed_pw = bcrypt( $password, $salt );
\&  if ( bcrypt( $hashed_pw, $salt ) eq $double_hashed_pw_from_db ) {
\&    session user => $user;
\&    session auth => $hashed_pw;
\&  }
\&
\&  # on each request
\&  if ( $double_hashed_pw_from_db ne bcrypt( session("auth"), $salt ) ) {
\&    context\->destroy_session;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
This latter approach means that even a compromise of the secret key and the
database contents can't be used to impersonate a user because doing so would
requiring reversing a one-way hash to determine the correct authenticator to
put into the forged cookie.
.PP
Both methods require an additional database read per request. This diminishes
some of the scalability benefits of storing session data in a cookie, but
the read could be cached and there is still no database write needed
to store session data.

.SH NAME
Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadClassHierarchy \- A Visitor for loading class hierarchies into a Tree::Simple hierarchy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&  use Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadClassHierarchy;
\&
\&  # create an visitor
\&  my $visitor = Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadClassHierarchy\->new();
\&
\&  # set class as an instance, or
\&  $visitor\->setClass($class);
\&
\&  # as a package name
\&  $visitor\->setClass("My::Class");
\&
\&  # pass our visitor to the tree
\&  $tree\->accept($visitor);
\&
\&  # the $tree now mirrors the inheritance hierarchy of the $class
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This visitor will traverse a class's inheritance hierarchy (through the \f(CW@ISA\fR arrays) and create a Tree::Simple hierarchy which mirrors it.
.SH METHODS
.IX Header "METHODS"
.IP \fBnew\fR 4
.IX Item "new"
There are no arguments to the constructor the object will be in its default state. You can use the \f(CW\*(C`setNodeFilter\*(C'\fR method to customize its behavior.
.IP "\fBincludeTrunk ($boolean)\fR" 4
.IX Item "includeTrunk ($boolean)"
Setting the \f(CW$boolean\fR value to true (\f(CW1\fR) will cause the node value of the \f(CW$tree\fR object passed into \f(CW\*(C`visit\*(C'\fR to be set with the root value found in the class hierarchy. Setting it to false (\f(CW0\fR), or not setting it, will result in the first value in the class hierarchy creating a new node level.
.IP "\fBincludeMethods ($boolean)\fR" 4
.IX Item "includeMethods ($boolean)"
Setting the \f(CW$boolean\fR value to true (\f(CW1\fR) will cause methods to be added as a children of the class node. Setting it to false (\f(CW0\fR), or not setting it, will result in this not happening.
.Sp
\&\fBNOTE:\fR Methods are sorted ascii-betically before they are added to the tree. This allows a more predictable hierarchy.
.IP "\fBsetClass ($class)\fR" 4
.IX Item "setClass ($class)"
The argument \f(CW$class\fR should be either a class name or an instance, it is then used as the root from which to determine the class hierarchy.
.IP "\fBsetNodeFilter ($filter_function)\fR" 4
.IX Item "setNodeFilter ($filter_function)"
This method accepts a CODE reference as its \f(CW$filter_function\fR argument and throws an exception if it is not a code reference. This code reference is used to filter the tree nodes as they are created, the \f(CW$filter_function\fR is passed the node value extracted from the hash prior to it being inserted into the tree being built. The \f(CW$filter_function\fR is expected to return the value desired for inclusion into the tree.
.IP "\fBvisit ($tree)\fR" 4
.IX Item "visit ($tree)"
This is the method that is used by Tree::Simple's \f(CW\*(C`accept\*(C'\fR method. It can also be used on its own, it requires the \f(CW$tree\fR argument to be a Tree::Simple object (or derived from a Tree::Simple object), and will throw and exception otherwise.
.Sp
The \f(CW$tree\fR argument which is passed to \f(CW\*(C`visit\*(C'\fR must be a leaf node. This is because this Visitor will create all the sub-nodes for this tree. If the tree is not a leaf, an exception is thrown. We do not require the tree to be a root though, and this Visitor will not affect any nodes above the \f(CW$tree\fR argument.
.SH "TO DO"
.IX Header "TO DO"
.ie n .IP "Improve the ""includeMethods"" functionality" 4
.el .IP "Improve the \f(CWincludeMethods\fR functionality" 4
.IX Item "Improve the includeMethods functionality"
I am not sure the tree this creates is the optimal tree for this situation. It is sufficient for now, until I have more of an \fIactual\fR need for this functionality.
.ie n .IP "Add ""includeFullSymbolTable"" functionality" 4
.el .IP "Add \f(CWincludeFullSymbolTable\fR functionality" 4
.IX Item "Add includeFullSymbolTable functionality"
This would traverse the full symbol tables and produce a detailed tree of everything it finds. This takes a lot more work, and as I have no current need for it, it remains in the TO DO list.
